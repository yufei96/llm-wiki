ABSTRACT  
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are changing the way military and civil operations are carried out. New 
types of vehicles, from different providers, each with its own specifications and characteristic, are 
continuously being developed. This diversity leads to an increased level of difficulty in terms of 
interoperability. The objective of STANAG 4586 is to specify the interfaces that shall be implemented in 
order to achieve the required Level of Interoperability (LOI) between different UAV systems, so as to meet 
the requirements of the concept of operations (CONOPS) defined by NATO countries. STANAG 4586 
establishes a functional architecture for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Control Systems (UCS) with the following 
elements and interfaces: Air Vehicle (AV), Vehicle Specific Module (VSM), Data Link Interface (DLI), Core 
UCS (CUCS), Command and Control Interface (CCI), Human Computer Interface (HCI), and Command 
and Control Interface Specific Module (CCISM).  Besides STANAG 4586, there are already a number of 
existing or emerging Standardization Agreements (STANAGs) that are applicable to UAV´s. They provide 
standards for interoperable data link (STANAG 7085), digital sensor data between the payload and the UAV 
element of the data link (STANAG 7023, 4545, 4607, and 4609), and for on-board recording device(s) 
(STANAG 7024 and 4575).  Although not providing a complete solution for interoperability, STANAG 4586 
is certainly a crucial step taken in that direction, providing a roadmap for future developments. 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
During the last years, Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) became a niche in continuous expansion within 
the aerospace market. With an investment that may exceed billions of dollars by 2015, it is predictable that 
the next generation will possess even more capabilities than today’s [1].  
The UAV´s are changing the way military and civil operations are carried out. This technology is gaining 
increasing awareness and promises to bring a higher level of efficiency to tasks such as data and image 
acquisition of areas of interest, localization and tracking of specific targets (target detection, classification 
and identification), map building, communication relays, pipeline surveying, border patrolling, military 
operations, policing duties, persistent wide area surveillance, search and rescue, and traffic surveillance. 
Therefore, the use of such systems provides a credible alternative to manned aircraft. They operate in 
conditions more dangerous with more autonomy and can be very cost-effective when compared to manned 
aircraft.  
A North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Interoperability Design Study was conducted in the early 
1990s to investigate ways to enable interoperability of electronic systems. One of the approaches considered 
was to mandate that all nations procure and operate the same systems. However, it was emphasised at this 
time that NATO could not mandate interoperability of national reconnaissance systems, but that 
interoperability among national systems would be purely voluntary. It was not considered a good idea to 
have one contractor monopolise the reconnaissance systems in NATO. Instead, a comparison was drawn 
between communications between reconnaissance systems and computer-to-computer communications. By

carefully defining an interface between two computers we can be assured of a successful exchange of data 
between them [2]. 
The evolution leads to the development of even more types of vehicles, from even more different providers, 
each with its own specifications and characteristics. This diversity leads to an increased level of difficulty in 
terms of guaranteed interoperability in teams of heterogeneous vehicles [3]. Most of the times the current 
operations with multiple vehicles and with multiple countries are as seen in Figure 1.  
 
 
Figure 1: Current UAV´s Operations Example [4]. 
 
The UAV´s have become valuable assets in helping Joint Force Commanders (JFCs) meet a variety of 
theatre, operational and tactical objectives. The optimum synergy among the various national UAV´s 
deployed requires close co-ordination and the ability to quickly task available UAV´s assets, the ability to 
mutually control the UAV´s and their payloads, as well as rapid dissemination of the resultant information at 
different command echelons. This requires the employed UAV´s to be interoperable [4]. 
Often, UAV’s are used for reconnaissance missions, which make them the predominant collection systems 
across virtually every echelon of command. As a consequence, the need to coordinate, share and integrate 
the UAV into the larger war fighting community is becoming painfully apparent [5]. 
UAV can be divided into these five different elements: vehicle (propulsion unit and avionics unit), payload 
(mission payload and payload recorder), data link (vehicle data terminal and control data terminal), UAV 
Control System (UCS) and launch/recovery, as shown in Figure 2.

Nowadays cooperative missions are in great demand. Missions using heterogeneous vehicles to perform 
complex operations are demanding more complex infrastructures to support them. There are many issues to 
address when working with different kinds of vehicles from different vendors, different capabilities and 
more important different interfaces to the end user. Interoperability is one of the most problematic issues. 
This is because there is no common acceptable interface. There are several interoperability efforts at several 
stages of development, but still not one widely accepted and used [6].  
1.1 
Standard and interoperability 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines a standard as a set of “requirements, 
specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that materials, products, 
processes and services are fit for their purpose” [7]. To ensure an appropriate level of development, 
advantage should be taken from existing standardization approaches while avoiding the risk of inheriting 
undesirable or restrictive complexity. The existing standards for interoperability are a mean to provide rules 
for the robots inner/outer communications. They define data and message types, operation modes and 
optionally transport protocols.  
Interoperability can be defined as the ability of robots to operate in synergy to the execution of assigned 
missions and the capability of diverse systems and organizations to work together, sharing data, intelligence 
and resources. The use of interoperability standards implies a secondary advantage. It also facilitates the 
compatibility with existing or future platforms and Command, Control and Intelligence (C2I) systems from 
other providers. Interoperability standards provide a common framework, working as the “glue” for 
unmanned systems. They minimize the integration time and development costs by avoiding custom

implementations. A common interface helps to easily integrate new technologies with minor or no 
modifications to the existing systems, and to expand existing systems with new sensors or capabilities. 
1.2 
NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 
Shortly after the establishment of NATO, it was recognized that the co-ordinated development of policies, 
procedures and equipment of the member nations held great potential for enhancing the military 
effectiveness and efficiency of the fledgling Alliance. As a result, the Military Agency for Standardization 
(MAS) was established in London in January 1951 for the purpose of fostering the standardization of 
operational and administrative practices and war material [8].  
In 1971 the MAS moved to NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where, following the 1998-2000 
review of the NATO Standardization Process, it was combined with the Office of NATO Standardization 
(which addressed broader standardization issues such as identifying overall Alliance standardization goals 
and co-ordination between operational and material activities). The Charter of the resultant NATO 
Standardization Agency (NSA), approved in August 2001, gave the NSA expanded responsibilities for the 
co-ordination of standardization activities within NATO [8].  
In July 2014, as a result of the NATO Agencies Reform, the NSA became without change in its mission the 
NATO Standardization Office (NSO). It is an integrated NATO Headquarters staff element, reporting to the 
Military Committee and the Committee for Standardization [8]. 
The STANAG (Standardisation Agreement) standards are published in English and French by NATO to 
provide common military or technical procedures for NATO members. They define processes, procedures, 
terms, and conditions for common procedures or equipment between the member countries of the alliance. 
STANAGs also form the basis for technical interoperability between a wide variety of communication and 
information systems (CIS). Some are publicly available in NATO's online library [8]. 
2.0 STANAG 4586 
In 1998, a NATO Specialist Team comprising members of government and industry (including CDL 
Systems) began work on NATO Standardization Agreement 4586 (STANAG 4586), a document conceived 
to standardize UCS interfaces to help enable UAV systems interoperability. STANAG 4586 Edition 1 was 
completed in 2003 and ratified by the member countries by 2004, Edition 2 was promulgated in 2007 and 
Edition 3 was promulgated in 2012 [4]. 
STANAG 4586 is divided into two annexes: the first annex provides a glossary to support the second annex, 
the second annex provides an overview of the communication architecture, which is supported by three 
appendices: appendix B1 discusses the data link interface, appendix B2 discusses the command and 
control interface (more specifically B2 covers the military architecture that connects the ground control 
station with the military command hierarchy), appendix B3 discusses the Human and Computer Interfaces 
(HCI) [4].  
Current or “legacy” UAV´s have been designed and procured nationally and contain system elements that 
are generally unique and system specific. They do not have standard interfaces between the system elements. 
This results in a variety of non-interoperable “stovepipe” systems. Although commonality of hardware and 
software would be a solution to achieve interoperability and may be desirable from an economic standpoint, 
commonality is not mandatory [4]. 
The objective of STANAG 4586 is to specify the interfaces that shall be implemented in order to achieve the 
required Level of Interoperability (LOI) according to the defined concept of operations (CONOPS). This will 
3 - 4 
STO-EN-SCI-271 
STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
be accomplished through implementing standard interfaces in the UCS to communicate with different UAVs 
and their payloads, as well as with different Command, Control, Communication, Computers and 
Intelligence (C4I) systems. The implementation of standard interfaces will also facilitate the integration of 
components from different sources as well as the interoperability of legacy systems. Compliant UAV´s shall 
be certified and will increase NATO joint flexibility through the sharing of assets [4].  
The standards in STANAG 4586, which are identified as mandatory, shall be implemented as a whole in 
order to achieve the required LOI. It is assumed that air safety regulations will require the certification of 
systems, which result from combining the operation of assets from different UAV´s. Compliance with 
STANAG 4586, will ease this process and likely UAV system combinations can be certified in advance. [4]. 
On this basis, UAV´s that are compliant with STANAG 4586 will increase NATO Combined/Joint Service 
flexibility and efficiency to meet mission objectives through the sharing of assets and common utilization of 
information generated from UAV´s [4]. 
2.1 
Level of Interoperability 
This standard also identifies five levels of interoperability (LOI) to accommodate operational requirements 
[4]. The respective operational requirements and CONOPS will determine or drive the required LOI that the 
specific UAV System will achieve. 
• 
Level 1: Indirect receipt and/or transmission of sensor product and associated metadata, for 
example Key Length Value Metadata Elements from the UAV. 
• 
Level 2:  Direct receipt of sensor product data and associated metadata from the UAV. 
• 
Level 3: Control and monitoring of the UAV payload unless specified as monitor only. 
• 
Level 4: Control and monitoring of the UAV, unless specified as monitor only, less launch and 
recovery. 
• 
Level 5: Control and monitoring of UAV launch and recovery unless specified as monitor only. 
LOI 2 monitor is conditional on the type of payload (station) and the number of payloads (stations) 
implemented onboard the UAV. It is also conditional on the type of payload data format used by the UAV 
[4]. 
 LOI 3 monitor only or control and monitor is conditional on the type of payload (station) and the number of 
payloads (stations) and the payload data format used by the UAV [4].   
LOI 4 monitor only or control and monitor is not affected by the payloads onboard the UAV [4]. 
2.2 
UCS Functional Architecture 
This architecture establishes the following elements and interfaces: Air Vehicle (AV), Vehicle Specific 
Module (VSM), Data Link Interface (DLI), Core UCS (CUCS), Command and Control Interface (CCI), 
Human Computer Interface (HCI), Command and Control Interface Specific Module (CCISM), as shown in 
Figure 3. 
STO-EN-SCI-271

STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
 
 
 
Figure 3: UCS Functional Architecture [4]. 
2.2.1 
Vehicle Specific Module (VSM) 
Provides unique/proprietary communication protocols, interface timing, data formats and “translation” of 
the DLI protocols and message formats that the respective Air Vehicle (AV) requires. This software 
provides a set of functions, such as [4]: 
• 
Translation of STANAG 4586 messages from the CUCS from/to the AV via DLI; 
• 
Packs/unpacks data to optimize transmission bandwidth; 
• 
Act as database; 
• 
Manage interfaces for data link messages control and monitoring; 
• 
Manage interfaces for launch and recovery operations; 
• 
Analogue to digital conversion of sensor data. 
VSM module is usually vehicle specific, provided by its manufacturer. However, this module is not 
necessary if the data links used by the vehicle are STANAG 4586 compatible [4]. 
 
3 - 6 
STO-EN-SCI-271 
STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
2.2.2 
Data Link Interface (DLI) 
The DLI, between the CUCS and the VSM element, enables the CUCS to generate and understand specific 
messages for control and status of air vehicles and payload [4]. DLI specifies the mechanism to process and 
display specific messages, which are air vehicle and payload independent. 
2.2.3 
Core UCS (CUCS) 
The CUCS should provide a user interface that enables the operator to conduct all phases of an UAV 
mission, and support all requirements from the DLI, CCI and HCI [4]. The computer generated graphic user 
interface should also enable the operator to control different types of UAVs and payloads. 
Depending on the desired level of interoperability in the respective UAV system, the CUCS should [4]: 
• 
Receive,  process  and  disseminate  payload  data  from  the  AV  and  its payload; 
• 
Perform mission planning; 
• 
Monitor and control the AV, payloads, and data links; 
• 
Support additional future AV and payload capabilities; 
• 
Provide  the  UAV  operator  the  necessary  tools  for  computer  related communications, mission 
tasking, mission planning, mission execution; 
• 
Be able to host VSM and CCISM functions. 
2.2.4 
Command and Control Interface (CCI) 
CCI defines the standard message set and accompanying protocols that have been selected to be C4I 
System/node independent, avoiding placing additional requirements on the C4I System [4]. 
The CCI is intended to cover all types of messages and data that need to be exchanged in both directions 
between the CUCS and the C4I systems during all the phases of a UAV mission, including [4]: 
• 
Before the flight: tasking messages, tactical situation, environmental data, general mission 
constraints and mission plans; 
• 
During the flight: status and service messages, payload data, progress reports; 
• 
After the flight: status and service messages, payload data, post-flight exploitation reports, mission 
reports. 
The networks and communications used to support the CCI interface should be NATO C3 Technical 
Architecture (NC3TA) compliant, which is a framework that provides interoperability among military 
command, control and communications systems, maximizing the exploitation of commercial off-the-shelf 
(COTS), and reducing proliferation of non-standard systems [4]. 
2.2.5 
Human Computer Interface (HCI) 
The STANAG specifies the requirements levied upon the CUCS, and does not impose any design 
requirements on human factors (HF) and ergonomics, (e.g., number of displays, manual controls, switches 
etc.)[4]. 
The HCI establishes the operator display and input requirements that the CUCS shall support. Although not 
specifically defining the format of the data to be displayed, there are some identified requirements that the 
CUCS shall provide in order to ensure an effective operation of the UAV system [4], such as display and 
operator interactions imposed on the CUCS by the CCI and DLI [4].

STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
 
 
2.2.6 
Command and Control Interface Specific Module (CCISM) 
The CCISM provides a function similar to the VSM, that is, the encapsulation of the CCI data and any 
translation required to be compatible/interoperable with the physical communication links between the UCS 
and the C4I systems [4]. 
The CCISM is mainly intended for communication with legacy C4I systems that are not directly compatible 
with STANAG 4586 specified standards, protocols or physical layer and can be hosted on and collocated 
with the UCS. The UCS architecture shall make provision for the integration of a CCISM [4]. 
The CCISM provides the encapsulation of the CCI data and translations required ensure interoperability 
with physical communications links between the UCS and C4I systems [4]. 
3.0 OTHER STANDARDIZATION AGREEMENTS RELEVANT FOR UAV 
As illustrated in Figure 4, there are already a number of existing or emerging Standardization Agreements 
(STANAGs) that are applicable to UAV´s. They provide standards for interoperable data links (STANAG 
7085), digital sensor data transfer between the payload and the UAV element of the data link (STANAG 
7023, 4545, 4607, and 4609), and for on-board recording device(s) (STANAG 7024 and 4575) [4].

STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
 
Figure 4: UAV Interoperability Architecture [4]. 
3.1 
STANAG 4545: NATO Secondary Imagery Format (NSIF)  
The NATO Secondary Imagery Format (NSIF) is the standard for formatting digital imagery files and 
imagery-related products and exchanging them among NATO members. The NSIF is part of a collection of 
related standards and specifications, known as the NATO ISR Interoperability Architecture (NIIA), 
developed to provide a foundation for interoperability in the dissemination of intelligence-related products 
among different computer systems [9]. 
Secondary imagery is sensor data that has been previously exploited and/or processed into a human readable 
picture. This format enables an operator at one workstation to compose and capture a multimedia image on 
his workstation, and send it to another workstation where it is capable of being reproduced exactly as it was 
composed on the first workstation [9]. 
The NSIF format can be composed of images, graphics and text. Because of the wide variety of display 
capabilities, the implementations of NSIF readers and writers are classified by their level of complexity, 
where the highest level will handle very large images with many bands of data, and the simplest level will 
only handle small, single band images [9]. 
STO-EN-SCI-271 
3 - 9 
STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
 
 
 The NSIF standard alone does not guarantee interoperability. Other aspects of the interface between systems 
(e.g. recording media, transmission protocols, etc.) must be considered based on other standards [2]. 
3.2 
STANAG 4575: NATO Advanced Data Storage Interface (NADSI) 
NATO Advanced data storage interface defines the standard for an interface to allow cross-servicing of ISR 
platforms by NATO nations´ground stations. The NADSI defines a multiple layer protocol for the lower 
levels of  the interface channel as defined in the International Standards Organizations – Open Systems 
Interconnection model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) [10].  
The interface is a high data rate port to allow direct download of the imagery and auxiliary data, either at the 
air platform or at the ground station. Once the memory has been transferred to a reconnaissance exploitation 
ground station, it can be exploited using normal tools [2]. 
This STANAG also defines the physical, electrical data/control, and power interface as well as the connector 
specifications [10]. 
The NADSI standard alone does not guarantee interoperability. Compatibility must also be assured at other 
protocol layers. Certifiable implementation of the NADSI for support of interoperability is subject to 
constraints not specified in this STANAG [10]. 
3.3 
STANAG 4607: NATO Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) format 
The NATO Ground Moving Target Indicator Format (GMTIF) defines a standard for the data content and 
format for the products of ground moving target indicator radar systems and a recommended mechanism for 
relaying tasking requests to the radar sensor system [11]. 
The GMTIF is a binary, message-oriented format for the prompt dissemination of Moving Target Indicator 
(MTI) data. It may be sent as a stand-alone format or it may be embedded in a frame-oriented format, such as 
the NATO Secondary Imagery Format (NSIF, STANAG 4545) or the National Imagery Transmission 
Format (NITF, Military Standard-2500) for the dissemination of secondary imagery, or in a message 
oriented format such as the NATO Primary Imagery Format (STANAG 7023) for the dissemination of 
primary imagery [11].  
This STANAG includes a notional employment concept for using the GMTIF, a suggested technique for 
embedding GMTIF data into NATO imagery formats, suggested groupings of GMTIF data fields to support 
three data exploitation classes, and tutorial information pertaining to the GMTIF [11]. 
The format provides a flexible format for target information, such that simple GMTI systems can use a small 
subset of the format with limited bandwidth channels, while robust systems can encode all aspects of the 
output data for use with wideband channels, including high range resolution (HRR) and pulse Doppler 
modes. It is also configured to be used as a stand-alone format, or can be encapsulated in either STANAG 
4545 or 7023 data streams. Target reports include such information as target location and radial velocity. 
Further value-added processing of the target movement can produce track histories of the individual targets 
[2].  
3.4 
STANAG 4609: NATO Digital Motion Imagery Standard 
Motion Imagery (MI) is a valuable asset for commanders that enable them to meet a variety of theatre, 
operational and tactical objectives for intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance. STANAG 4609 is 
intended to provide common methods for exchange of MI across systems within and among NATO nations 
[12]. 
3 - 10 
STO-EN-SCI-271 
STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
This standard addresses the applicability of commercial digital video standards and defines the metadata 
requirements for airborne motion imagery collection. The standard specifies the commercial standards to be 
used for the military community within NATO. In addition, careful consideration was taken to define the 
relationship between the motion imagery standard and STANAG 7023 and STANAG 4545 [12].  
The military-unique metadata considerations for motion imagery were analysed and included in the standard 
[12]. 
3.5 
STANAG 7023: Air Reconnaissance Primary Imagery Data Standard 
STANAG 7023 establishes a standard data format and a standard transport architecture for the transfer of 
reconnaissance imagery and associated auxiliary data between reconnaissance Collection Systems and 
Exploitation Systems [13].  
NATO STANAG 7023 is not a communications protocol. NATO STANAG 7023 works in conjunction with 
other NATO STANAGs 7085, 7024, 4575, 4545, 4559, 4607, 4609 and 3377 to complete the interface 
between the Collection System and the Exploitation System [13].  
The following list of top level design aims for NATO STANAG 7023 establishes a basis for the design [13]: 
• 
promote interoperability; 
• 
 handle primary imagery; 
• 
 handle mission/intelligence data; 
• 
work in real time; 
• 
minimise platform processing; 
• 
assume exploitation of imagery has no prior knowledge of source; 
• 
image format does not handicap sensor performance; 
• 
digital and analogue versions; 
• 
layered/modular architecture; 
• 
end-to-end protocol; 
• 
self-describing sensor data format; 
• 
addressable data files; 
• 
multi-sensor/multispectral; 
• 
hardware independent; 
• 
expandable. 
NATO STANAG 7023 is a self-describing format. The auxiliary data defines the format of the image data. 
This enables NATO STANAG 7023 to handle any image from any type of sensor [13]. 
3.6 
STANAG 7024: Air Reconnaissance Tape Recorder Interface  
Reconnaissance systems have been film based. Now in the era of electo-optical digital (EO), radar 
reconnaissance sensors and exploitation technology, common/standardised data exchange formats are 
necessary to assure interoperability between a multiplicity of sensor and exploitation systems [14]. 
STO-EN-SCI-271 
3 - 11 
STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
 
 
STANAG 7024 was established to ensure the ability to exchange air reconnaissance sensor recordings and 
associated auxiliary data within NATO and Allied users, by the use of recording standards for media and 
recording footprints [14]. 
This STANAG establishes the physical format for the exchange of magnetic tape cartridges for 4 different 
technologies of recorders [14]: 
• 
19mm helical scan ANSI ID-1 digital instrumentation recorder with large, medium and small   tape 
cartridge formats; 
• 
8 mm helical scan Hi-8 digital, and 8mm analogue;  
• 
12.65 mm helical scan SVHS analogue recorder;  
• 
25.4 mm transverse scan AMPEX DCRSi digital instrumentation recorder).  
All the recorders in STANAG 7024 are sequential access[14]. 
3.7 
STANAG 7085: Interoperable Data Links for Imaging Systems  
This STANAG provides the interoperability standards for 3 classes of imagery data link used for primary 
imagery data transmission: analogue links described in Annex A, point-to-point digital links described in 
Annex B, and broadcast digital links described in Annex C. Command and control of the sensors and 
platform is an auxiliary mission. Annex B is organized in 2 chapters “General Requirements” and 
“Implementation Directives” which describe point-to-point digital links. Different implementation profiles 
are possible: the U.S. Common Data Link (CDL) is described in Implementation 1 [2]. 
This standard is structured to provide a number of options for the specific data link configuration, such as 
simplex or duplex operation, data rate, carrier frequency, channel multiplexing, interleaving, encryption, and 
many others that must be matched prior to passing data from transmitter to receiver [2]. 
STANAG 7085 data links can handle any form of data (e.g. 7023, 4545, or GMTI), and can operate in 
different configurations, including two way (half or full duplex) modes. 
Sensitive information such as real-time terminal position that is transmitted via the data link may require 
protection. This protection may be provided by encrypting all or portions of the data stream using any 
equipment or technique that has been approved by the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency 
(NC3A) [15]. 
4.0 CONCLUSIONS 
STANAG 4586 is a message based standard that was originally developed to meet the requirements of long 
endurance UAV’s. 
This standard includes messages that are specifically written to support communication with a UAV’s 
payload. Since payload is not incorporated into the certification process, these messages may be eliminated 
or modified. Fortunately, few messages incorporate both control and payload aspects.  
NATO Standardization Agreements are constrained to NATO member states and may become a limitation to 
intervene in non-NATO countries. For instance, STANAG 4586 is NATO "UNCLASSIFIED". This may (or 
may not) become a barrier to many global suppliers & non- traditional innovators from non-NATO countries 
such as robotics leaders in Japan [4].

STO-EN-SCI-271 
STANAG 4586–Standard Interfaces of UCS for NATO UAV Interoperability 
STANAGs  are  predominantly  military  standards,  and even  though  they  have  been  promoted  for  civil 
applications, their requirements are heavily demanding in terms of compliance. For instance, certifying a 
platform against the STANAG 7085 Interoperable Data Links for Imaging Systems is costly and probably a 
barrier for small platforms providers. In this sense, STANAG is perhaps very relevant for the interoperability 
of military asset across the different NATO members, but it is hard to be adopted by civil or research 
platforms without strong investment. 
STANAG does not define a specific Common Operating Environment (COE), but only specifies that the 
operating environment supports/ integrates the specified network/transport protocols and supports the 
specified user applications [5]. Moreover, STANAG doesn’t take into account that the vehicles can be part of 
a network with dynamic topology where communications can be unreliable and vehicle actions may be tied 
to communication constraints. 
Although not providing a complete solution for interoperability, STANAG 4586 is certainly a crucial step 
taken in that direction, providing a roadmap for future developments.
