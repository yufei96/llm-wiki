ABSTRACT 

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-160, Volume 2, focuses on cyber resiliency engineering—an 
emerging specialty systems engineering discipline applied in conjunction with systems security 
engineering and resilience engineering to develop survivable, trustworthy secure systems. Cyber 
resiliency engineering intends to architect, design, develop, implement, maintain, and sustain 
the trustworthiness of systems with the capability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and 
adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises that use or are enabled by cyber 
resources. From a risk management perspective, cyber resiliency is intended to help reduce the 
mission, business, organizational, enterprise, or sector risk of depending on cyber resources. 

This publication can be used in conjunction with ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, Systems and 
software engineering—Systems life cycle processes; NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-160, 
Volume 1, Systems Security Engineering—Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the 
Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems; NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for 
Information Systems and Organizations—A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy; 
and NIST SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations. It 
can be viewed as a handbook for achieving the identified cyber resiliency outcomes based on a 
systems engineering perspective on system life cycle and risk management processes, allowing 
the experience and expertise of the implementing organization to help determine how the 
content will be used for its purpose. Organizations can select, adapt, and use some or all of the 
cyber resiliency constructs (i.e., goals, objectives, techniques, approaches, and design principles) 
described in this publication and apply the constructs to the technical, operational, and threat 
environments for which systems need to be engineered.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The goal of the NIST Systems Security Engineering initiative is to address security, safety, and 
resiliency issues from the perspective of stakeholder requirements and protection needs using 
established engineering processes to ensure that those requirements and needs are addressed 
across the entire system life cycle to develop more trustworthy systems.1 To that end, NIST 
Special Publication (SP) 800-160, Volume 2, focuses on cyber resiliency engineering—an 
emerging specialty systems engineering discipline applied in conjunction with resilience 
engineering and systems security engineering to develop more survivable, trustworthy systems. 
Cyber resiliency engineering intends to architect, design, develop, maintain, and sustain the 
trustworthiness of systems with the capability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt 
to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises that use or are enabled by cyber 
resources. From a risk management perspective, cyber resiliency is intended to reduce the 
mission, business, organizational, or sector risk of depending on cyber resources. 

This publication can be used in conjunction with ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, Systems and 
software engineering—Systems life cycle processes; NIST SP 800-160, Volume 1, Systems 
Security Engineering—Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of 
Trustworthy Secure Systems; NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information 
Systems and Organizations—A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy; and NIST SP 
800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations. The 
application of the concepts in this publication—in combination with the system life cycle 
processes in SP 800-160, Volume 1, and the risk management methodology in SP 800-37—can 
be viewed as a handbook for achieving cyber resiliency outcomes. Guided and informed by 
stakeholder protection needs, mission and business assurance needs, and stakeholder concerns 
with cost, schedule, and performance, the cyber resiliency constructs and analysis approach can 
be applied to critical systems to identify, prioritize, and implement solutions to meet the unique 
cyber resiliency needs of organizations. 
 
NIST SP 800-160, Volume 2, presents a cyber resiliency engineering framework to aid in 
understanding and applying cyber resiliency, a concept of use for the framework, and the 
engineering considerations for implementing cyber resiliency in the system life cycle. The 
framework constructs include goals, objectives, techniques, implementation approaches, and 
design principles. Organizations can select, adapt, and use some or all of the cyber resiliency 
constructs in this publication and apply the constructs to the technical, operational, and threat 
environments for which systems need to be engineered. 

Building from the cyber resiliency engineering framework, this publication also identifies 
considerations for determining which cyber resiliency constructs are most relevant to a system 
of interest and a tailorable cyber resiliency analysis approach to apply the cyber resiliency 
concepts, constructs, and practices to a system. The cyber resiliency analysis is intended to 

 

1 In the context of systems engineering, trustworthiness means being trusted to fulfill whatever critical requirements 
may be needed for a particular component, subsystem, system, network, application, mission, enterprise, or other 
entity. Trustworthiness requirements can include attributes of safety, security, reliability, dependability, performance, 
resilience, and survivability under a wide range of potential adversity in the form of disruptions, hazards, and threats 
[SP 800-160 v1].

determine whether the cyber resiliency properties and behaviors of a system of interest, 
wherever it is in the life cycle, are sufficient for the organization using that system to meet its 
mission assurance, business continuity, or other security requirements in a threat environment 
that includes the advanced persistent threat (APT). A cyber resiliency analysis is performed with 
the expectation that such analysis will support engineering and risk management decisions 
about the system of interest.  

The cyber resiliency engineering framework is supplemented by several technical appendices 
that provide additional information to support its application, including: 

• 
Background and contextual information on cyber resiliency 

• 
Detailed descriptions of the individual cyber resiliency constructs (i.e., goals, objectives, 
techniques, implementation approaches, design principles) that are part of the cyber 
resiliency engineering framework 

• 
Controls in [SP 800-53] that directly support cyber resiliency (including the questions used to 
determine if controls support cyber resiliency, the relevant controls, and cyber resiliency 
techniques and implementation approaches) 

• 
An approach for adversary-oriented analysis of a system and applications of cyber resiliency, 
a vocabulary to describe the current or potential effects of a set of mitigations, and a 
representative analysis of how cyber resiliency approaches and controls could mitigate 
adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures 

• 
An analysis of the potential effects of cyber resiliency on adversary tactics, techniques, and 
procedures used to attack operational technologies (e.g., Industrial Control Systems)

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISO 15288 AND OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE 

Although the focus of [ISO 15288] is systems and software engineering processes, operational 
resilience, which includes cyber resiliency for systems that include or depend on cyber resources, 
is addressed indirectly by requiring organization-wide commitment, resources, practices, and 
processes. The interacting elements in the definition of a system include layers of resilience in 
hardware, software, data, information, humans, processes, procedures, facilities, materials, and 
naturally occurring physical entities. This is important because if the organization’s missions or 
business functions require sustainability during perturbations, disruptions, disturbances, or 
cyber-attacks, then operational resilience practices and procedures must be applied to all of the 
system’s assets. It would be of limited value to have resilience measures implemented in the 
software architecture if there is no redundancy and survivability in the hardware, if the 
communications networks are fragile, if critical personnel are not available (e.g., in a natural 
disaster or inclement weather) to operate and maintain the system, or if there are no facilities 
available for producing the organization’s products and/or services.

ADVERSARY PERSISTENCE AND LONG-TERM PRESENCE 

Numerous reports of cyber incidents and cyber breaches indicate that extended periods of time 
transpired between the time an adversary initially established a presence in an organizational 
system by exploiting a vulnerability and when that presence was revealed or detected. In certain 
instances, the time period before detection can be as long as months or years. In the worst case, 
the adversary’s presence may never be detected. 

The following examples illustrate the types of situations in which an adversary can maintain a 
long-term presence or persistence in a system without attacking the system via cyberspace: 

- Compromising the pre-execution environment of a system through a hardware or software 
implant (e.g., compromise of the firmware or microcode of a system element, such as a 
network switch or a router, that activates before initialization in the system's environment of 
operation). This is extremely difficult to detect and can result in compromise of the entire 
environment. 

- Compromising the software development toolchain (e.g., compilers, linkers, interpreters, 
continuous integration tools, code repositories). This allows malicious code to be inserted by 
the adversary without modifying the source code or without the knowledge of the software 
developers. 

- Compromising a semiconductor product or process (e.g., maliciously altering the hardware 
description language [HDL] of a microprocessor, a field-programmable gate array [FPGA], a 
digital signal processor [DSP], or an application-specific integrated circuit [ASIC]).

THREAT DETECTION AND CYBER RESILIENCY 

Cyber resiliency is based on the recognition that adversaries can establish and maintain a covert 
presence in systems. Therefore, many cyber resiliency techniques and approaches are not 
predicated on the assumption of successfully detecting adversity, including cyber-attacks. These 
include the Coordinated Protection, Deception, Diversity, Non-Persistence, Realignment, 
Redundancy, Substantiated Integrity, and Unpredictability techniques, and the Fragmentation, 
Distributed Functionality, Predefined Segmentation, Attribute-Based Usage Restriction, and 
Trust-Based Privilege Management approaches. 

Other techniques and approaches can provide automatic responses or support cyber defender 
responses to detected indicators of possible or suspected adversity or to warnings of potential 
forthcoming adverse conditions (including announcements of planned outages of supporting 
services or the predictions of increased system load). These include the Adaptive Response 
technique and the Functional Relocation of Sensors, Functional Relocation of Cyber Resources, 
Asset Mobility, Dynamic Privileges, and Dynamic Segmentation and Isolation approaches. 

Two cyber resiliency techniques directly involve the detection of adversity or its effects: Analytic 
Monitoring and Contextual Awareness. The Substantiated Integrity technique and the 
Consistency Analysis approach support detection of some effects of adversity.

PROLOGUE 

“Providing satisfactory security controls in a computer system is in itself a system design problem. A 
combination of hardware, software, communications, physical, personnel and administrative-
procedural safeguards is required for comprehensive security. In particular, software safeguards 
alone are not sufficient.” 

The Ware Report 
Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, 1970. 

“Mission assurance requires systems that behave with predictability and proportionality.” 

General Michael Hayden 
Former NSA and CIA Director, Syracuse University, October 2009 

“In the past, it has been assumed that to show that a system is safe, it is sufficient to provide 
assurance that the process for identifying the hazards has been as comprehensive as possible, and 
that each identified hazard has one or more associated controls. While historically this approach 
has been used reasonably effectively to ensure that known risks are controlled, it has become 
increasingly apparent that evolution to a more holistic approach is needed as systems become 
more complex and the cost of designing, building, and operating them become more of an issue.”

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 
THE NEED FOR CYBER-RESILIENT SYSTEMS 

he need for trustworthy secure systems2 stems from a variety of stakeholder needs that 
are driven by mission, business, and other objectives and concerns. The principles, 
concepts, and practices for engineering trustworthy secure systems can be expressed in 
various ways, depending on which aspect of trustworthiness is of concern to stakeholders. NIST 
Special Publication (SP) 800-160, Volume 1 [SP 800-160 v1], provides guidance on systems 
security engineering with an emphasis on protection against asset loss.3 In addition to security, 
other aspects of trustworthiness include reliability, safety, and resilience. Specialty engineering 
disciplines address different aspects of trustworthiness. While each discipline frames the 
problem domain and the potential solution space for its aspect of trustworthiness somewhat 
differently, [SP 800-160 v1] includes systems engineering processes to align the concepts, 
frameworks, and analytic processes from multiple disciplines to make trade-offs within and 
between the various aspects of trustworthiness applicable to a system of interest.4  

NIST SP 800-160, Volume 2, focuses on the property of cyber resiliency, which has a strong 
relationship to security and resilience but provides a distinctive framework for its identified 
problem domain and solution space. Cyber resiliency is the ability to anticipate, withstand, 
recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems 
that use or are enabled by cyber resources.5  

Cyber resiliency can be sought at multiple levels, including for system elements, systems, 
missions or business functions and the system-of-systems that support those functions, 
organizations, sectors, regions, the Nation, or transnational missions/business functions. From 
an engineering perspective, cyber resiliency is an emergent quality property of an engineered 
system, where an “engineered system” can be a system element made up of constituent 
components, a system, or a system-of-systems. Cyber-resilient systems are systems that have 
security measures or safeguards “built in” as a foundational part of the architecture and design 
and that display a high level of resiliency. Thus, cyber-resilient systems can withstand cyber-
attacks, faults, and failures and continue to operate in a degraded or debilitated state to carry 
out the mission-essential functions of the organization. From an enterprise risk management 
perspective, cyber resiliency is intended to reduce the mission, business, organizational, or 
sector risk of potentially compromised cyber resources. 

 

2 A system is a combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purpose. The interacting 
system elements that compose a system include hardware, software, data, humans, processes, procedures, facilities, 
materials, and naturally occurring entities [ISO 15288]. 

3 An asset refers to an item of value to stakeholders. Assets may be tangible (e.g., a physical item, such as hardware, 
firmware, computing platform, network device, or other technology component, or individuals in key or defined roles 
in organizations) or intangible (e.g., data, information, software, trademark, copyright, patent, intellectual property, 
image, or reputation). Refer to [SP 800-160 v1] for the systems security engineering perspective on assets. 

4 A system of interest is a system whose life cycle is under consideration in the context of [ISO 15288]. A system of 
interest can also be viewed as the focus of the systems engineering effort. The system of interest contains system 
elements, system element interconnections, and the environment in which they are placed. 

5 A cyber resource is an information resource which creates, stores, processes, manages, transmits, or disposes of 
information in electronic form and that can be accessed via a network or using networking methods.

Cyber resiliency supports mission assurance in a contested environment for missions that 
depend on systems that include cyber resources. A cyber resource is an information resource 
that creates, stores, processes, manages, transmits, or disposes of information in electronic 
form and that can be accessed via a network or using networking methods. However, some 
information resources are specifically designed to be accessed using a networking method only 
intermittently (e.g., via a low-power connection to check the status of an insulin pump, via a 
wired connection to upgrade software in an embedded avionic device). These cyber resources 
are characterized as operating primarily in a disconnected or non-networked mode.6 

 

 

Systems incorporate cyber resources as system elements and may be susceptible to harm7 
resulting from the effects of adversity8 on those resources and particularly to harm resulting 
from cyber-attacks. In some cases, susceptibility to harm may exist even with the employment 
of traditional cybersecurity safeguards and countermeasures intended to protect systems from 
adversity. The cyber resiliency problem is defined as how to achieve adequate mission resilience 
by providing (1) adequate system resilience9 and (2) adequate mission/business function and 
operational/organizational resilience in the presence of possible adversities that affect cyber 
resources. The cyber resiliency problem domain overlaps with the security problem domain 
since a system should be securely resilient.10 

 

6 Some information resources, which include computing hardware, software, and stored information, are designed to 
be inaccessible via networking methods but can be manipulated physically or electronically to yield information or to 
change behavior (e.g., side-channel attacks on embedded cryptographic hardware). Such system elements may also 
be considered cyber resources for the purposes of cyber resiliency engineering analysis. 

7 The term harm can refer to physical harm, damage, or adverse mission, business, or operational impact. 

8 The term adversity is used in this publication to mean adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises and is 
consistent with the use of the term in [SP 800-160 v1] as disruptions, hazards, and threats. Adversity in the context of 
the definition of cyber resiliency specifically includes but is not limited to cyber-attacks. For example, cyber resiliency 
engineering analysis considers the potential consequences of physical destruction of a cyber resource to the system 
of interest of which that resource is a system element. 

9 System resilience is defined by the INCOSE Resilient Systems Working Group (RSWG) as “the capability of a system 
with specific characteristics before, during, and after a disruption to absorb the disruption, recover to an acceptable 
level of performance, and sustain that level for an acceptable period of time [INCOSE11].” 

10 The term securely resilient refers to the system’s ability to preserve a secure state despite disruption, including the 
system transitions between normal and degraded modes. A primary objective of systems security engineering [SP 
800-160 v1] is ensuring that the system is securely resilient. 

CYBER-RESILIENT SYSTEMS 

Cyber-resilient systems operate like the human body. The human body has an effective immune 
system that can readily absorb a continuous barrage of environmental hazards and provides the 
necessary defense mechanisms to maintain a healthy state. The body also has self-repair 
systems to recover from illnesses and injuries when defenses are breached. But cyber-resilient 
systems, like the human body, cannot defend against all hazards at all times. While the body 
cannot always recover to the same state of health as before an injury or illness, it can adapt. 
Similarly, cyber-resilient systems can recover minimal essential functionality (e.g., functionality 
to meet critical mission needs). Understanding the limitations of individuals, organizations, and 
systems is fundamental to managing risk.

The cyber resiliency problem domain is informed by an understanding of the threat landscape 
and, in particular, the advanced persistent threat (APT). The APT stems from an adversary that 
possesses significant levels of expertise and resources that allow it to create opportunities to 
achieve its objectives by using multiple attack vectors, including cyber, physical, and deception. 
These objectives include establishing and extending footholds within the systems of targeted 
organizations for the express purposes of exfiltrating information; undermining or impeding 
critical aspects of a mission, program, or organization; or positioning itself to carry out these 
objectives in the future. The APT pursues its objectives repeatedly over an extended period, 
adapts to defenders’ efforts to resist it, and is determined to maintain the level of interaction 
needed to execute its objectives [SP 800-39] [CNSSI 4009].11 In addition, the APT can take 
advantage of human errors (e.g., lapses in basic cybersecurity), exploit other stresses on systems 
(e.g., increased or unusual system use in response to a natural disaster or other event), and 
execute sophisticated supply chain attacks. 

All discussions of cyber resiliency focus on assuring mission or business functions and are 
predicated on the assumption that the adversary will breach defenses and establish a long-term 
presence in organizational systems. A cyber-resilient system is a system that provides a degree 
of cyber resiliency commensurate with the system’s criticality. 

1.1   PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY 

The purpose of this publication is to provide guidance on how to apply cyber resiliency concepts, 
constructs, and engineering practices to systems security engineering and risk management for 
systems and organizations.12 This publication identifies considerations for the engineering of the 
following types of systems that depend on cyber resources:13 

• 
General-purpose or multi-use systems (e.g., enterprise information technology [EIT]), shared 
services, or common infrastructures 

• 
Dedicated or special-purpose systems (e.g., security-dedicated/purposed systems) 

• 
Large-scale processing environments 

• 
Cyber-physical systems [CPS]14 

• 
Internet of Things [IoT] or Network of Things [NoT]15 devices 

• 
Systems-of-systems (e.g., critical infrastructure systems [CIS]) 

 

11 While some sources define the APT to be an adversary at Tier V or Tier VI in the threat model in [DSB13], in 
particular, to be a state actor, the definition used in this publication includes any actors with the characteristics 
described above. The above definition also includes adversaries who subvert the supply chain to compromise cyber 
resources, which are subsequently made part of the system of interest. As discussed in Chapter Two and Section D.2, 
the APT is a crucial aspect of the threat landscape for cyber resiliency engineering.  

12 This guidance can be used to supplement [SP 800-160 v1] and [SP 800-37] or other risk management processes. 

13 This list is not intended to be exhaustive or mutually exclusive. Circumstances and types of systems are discussed in 
more detail in Section 2.2 and Section 3.1.3. 

14 A cyber-physical system (CPS) includes engineered interacting networks of computational and physical 
components. CPSs range from simple devices to complex systems-of-systems. A CPS device has an element of 
computation and interacts with the physical world through sensing and actuation [SP 1500-201]. 

15 A Network of Things (NoT) is a system of devices that include a sensor and a communications capability, a network, 
software that aggregates sensor data, and an external utility (i.e., a software or hardware product or service that 
executes processes or feeds data into the system) [SP 800-183].

The guidance in this publication can be applied to new systems, reactive modifications to fielded 
systems, planned upgrades to fielded systems while continuing to sustain day-to-day operations, 
evolving systems, and systems identified for retirement. 

1.2   TARGET AUDIENCE 

This publication is intended for systems security engineering and other professionals who are 
responsible for the activities and tasks related to the system life cycle processes in [SP 800-160 
v1], the risk management processes in [SP 800-39], or the Risk Management Framework (RMF) 
in [SP 800-37].16 The term systems security engineer is used in this publication to include those 
security professionals who perform any of the activities and tasks in [SP 800-160 v1]. This 
publication can also be used by professionals who perform other system life cycle activities that 
impact trustworthiness or who perform activities related to the education or training of systems 
engineers and systems security engineers. These include but are not limited to: 

• 
Individuals with systems engineering, architecture, design, development, and integration 
responsibilities 

• 
Individuals with software engineering, architecture, design, development, integration, and 
software maintenance responsibilities 

• 
Individuals with acquisition, budgeting, and project management responsibilities 

• 
Individuals with security governance, risk management, and oversight responsibilities, 
particularly those defined in [SP 800-37] 

• 
Individuals with forensic and threat analysis responsibilities 

• 
Individuals with independent security verification, validation, testing, evaluation, auditing, 
assessment, inspection, and monitoring responsibilities 

• 
Individuals with system security administration, operations, maintenance, sustainment, 
logistics, and support responsibilities 

• 
Providers of technology products, systems, or services 

• 
Academic institutions offering systems security engineering and related programs 

This publication assumes that the systems security engineering activities in [SP 800-160 v1] and 
risk management processes in [SP 800-37] are performed under the auspices of, or within, an 
organization (referred to as “the organization” in this document).17 The activities and processes 
take into consideration the concerns of a variety of stakeholders, within and external to the 
organization. The organization—through systems security engineering and risk management 

 

16 This includes security and risk management practitioners with significant responsibilities for the protection of 
existing systems, information, and the information technology infrastructure within enterprises (i.e., the installed 
base). Such practitioners may use the cyber resiliency content in this publication in other than engineering-based 
system life cycle processes. These application areas may include the use of the Risk Management Framework [SP 800-
37], the controls in [SP 800-53], or the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity [NIST CSF] where 
such applications have cyber resiliency-related concerns. 

17 Systems security engineering and risk management apply to systems-of-systems in which multiple organizations are 
responsible for constituent systems. In such situations, systems security engineering and risk management activities 
are performed within individual organizations (each an instance of “the organization”) and supported by cooperation 
or coordination across those organizations.

activities—identifies stakeholders, elicits their concerns, and represents those concerns in the 
systems security engineering and risk management activities. 

1.3   HOW TO USE THIS PUBLICATION 

This publication is intended to be used in conjunction with [SP 800-160 v1] and is designed to be 
flexible in its application to meet the diverse and changing needs of systems and organizations. 
It is not intended to provide a “recipe” for execution or a “cookbook” approach to developing 
cyber-resilient systems. Rather, the publication can be viewed as a tutorial for achieving the 
identified cyber resiliency outcomes from a systems engineering perspective, leveraging the 
experience and expertise of the individuals in the organization to determine what is correct for 
its purpose. 

Stakeholders who choose to use this guidance can employ some or all of the cyber resiliency 
constructs (i.e., goals, objectives, techniques, approaches, and design principles) as well as the 
analytic and life cycle processes, tailoring them to the technical, operational, and threat 
environments for which systems need to be engineered. In addition, organizations that choose 
to use this guidance for their systems security engineering efforts can select and employ some 
or all of the 30 processes in [ISO 15288] and some or all of the security-related activities and 
tasks defined for each process. Note that there are process dependencies in [ISO 15288]. The 
successful completion of some activities and tasks invokes other processes or leverages the 
results of other processes. 

The system life cycle processes can be used for new systems, system upgrades, or systems that 
are being repurposed. The processes can be employed at any stage of the system life cycle and 
can take advantage of any system or software development methodology, including waterfall, 
spiral, or agile. The life cycle processes can also be applied recursively, iteratively, concurrently, 
sequentially, or in parallel and to any system regardless of its size, complexity, purpose, scope, 
environment of operation, or special nature. 

The full extent of the application of the content in this publication is informed by stakeholder 
needs, organizational capabilities, cyber resiliency goals and objectives, cost, schedule, and 
performance. The tailorable nature of the engineering activities and tasks and the system life 
cycle processes help to ensure that the systems resulting from the application of the security 
design principles and concepts have a level of trustworthiness deemed sufficient to protect 
stakeholders from suffering unacceptable losses of assets and the associated consequences. 
Such trustworthiness is made possible by the rigorous application of these cyber resiliency 
constructs within a structured set of processes that provides the necessary evidence and 
transparency to support risk-informed decision making and trades.

FLEXIBLE APPLICATION OF CYBER RESILIENCY GUIDANCE 

While this publication focuses on cyber resiliency engineering, the higher-level cyber resiliency 
constructs (i.e., cyber resiliency goals, objectives, and techniques) are defined to have broad 
applicability. The definitions of these constructs are written in a technology-neutral manner and 
are silent with regard to cyber resources. Thus, while these constructs can be applied to “cyber 
systems” (i.e., systems entirely constituted of cyber resources or for which cyber components 
are viewed as central), they can also be readily applied to “non-cyber systems”— that is, systems 
that include no cyber resources (e.g., water-powered sawmills). For the lower-level construct of 
cyber resiliency implementation approaches, the definitions become technology-specific and 
focus on cyber resources. Moreover, except for the Deception and Unpredictability techniques, 
the higher-level constructs are defined so that they can be applied to adversarial (e.g., cyber-
attacks) and non-adversarial (e.g., fires, floods) threat events.   

The technology-neutral (and largely threat-neutral) nature of the higher-level cyber resiliency 
constructs reflects the fact that they are drawn from well-established, cross-cutting resilience 
concepts. In addition, it means that stakeholders and systems engineers for non-cyber systems 
(or systems for which cyber components are not viewed as central) can apply many of the 
constructs described in this publication, as can systems that are not concerned with adversarial 
threat events. This may prove beneficial given the rapid convergence of cyber and physical 
systems that reflects a movement of cyber into traditional non-cyber realms (e.g., vehicles, 
medical devices) and the growth of bio-integrated technology. 

Finally, while much of the cyber resiliency analysis in this publication uses the MITRE Adversarial 
Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK™) framework [Strom17], organizations 
can employ any framework that is suitable to their organizational needs.

CHAPTER TWO 

THE FUNDAMENTALS 
UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH CYBER RESILIENCY 

his section presents an engineering framework for understanding and applying cyber 
resiliency, the cyber resiliency constructs that are part of the framework, a concept of use 
for the framework, and engineering considerations for implementing cyber resiliency in 
the system life cycle. The discussion relies on several terms including cyber resiliency concepts 
and constructs, engineering practices, and solutions. 

Cyber resiliency concepts are related to the problem domain and the solution set for cyber 
resiliency. The concepts are represented in cyber resiliency risk models and by cyber resiliency 
constructs.19 The constructs are the basic elements (i.e., building blocks) of the cyber resiliency 
engineering framework and include goals, objectives, techniques, implementation approaches, 
and design principles.20 The framework provides a way to understand the cyber resiliency 
problem and solution domain. Cyber resiliency goals and objectives identify the “what” of cyber 
resiliency—that is, what properties and behaviors are integral to cyber-resilient systems. Cyber 
resiliency techniques, implementation approaches, and design principles characterize the ways 
of achieving or improving resilience in the face of threats to systems and system components 
(i.e., the “how” of cyber resiliency). Cyber resiliency constructs address both adversarial and 
non-adversarial threats from cyber and non-cyber sources. 

Cyber resiliency engineering practices are the methods, processes, modeling, and analytical 
techniques used to identify and analyze proposed solutions. The application of these practices in 
system life cycle processes ensures that cyber resiliency solutions are driven by stakeholder 
requirements and protection needs, which, in turn, guide and inform the development of 
system requirements for the system of interest [ISO 15288, SP 800-160 v1]. Such solutions 
consist of combinations of technologies, architectural decisions, systems engineering processes, 
and operational policies, processes, procedures, or practices that solve problems in the cyber 
resiliency domain. They provide a sufficient level of cyber resiliency to meet stakeholder needs 
and reduce risks to organizational mission or business capabilities in the presence of a variety of 
threat sources, including the APT. 

Cyber resiliency solutions use cyber resiliency techniques and approaches to implementing 
those techniques, as described in Section 2.1.3. Cyber resiliency solutions apply the design 
principles described in Section 2.1.4 and implement mechanisms (e.g., controls and control 
enhancements defined in [SP 800-53]) that apply one or more cyber resiliency techniques or 
implementation approaches or that are intended to achieve one or more cyber resiliency 
objectives. These mechanisms are selected in response to the security and cyber resiliency 
requirements defined as part of the system life cycle and requirements engineering process 
described in [SP 800-160 v1] or to mitigate security and cyber resiliency risks that arise from 
architectural or design decisions. 

 

19 As discussed in Section D.1, cyber resiliency concepts and constructs are informed by definitions and frameworks 
related to other forms of resilience as well as system survivability. A reader unfamiliar with the concept of resilience 
may benefit from reading that appendix before this section.  

20 Additional constructs (e.g., sub-objectives, capabilities) may be used in some modeling and analytic practices.

2.1   CYBER RESILIENCY ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK 

The following sections provide a description of the framework for cyber resiliency engineering.21 
The framework constructs include cyber resiliency goals, objectives, techniques, implementation 
approaches, and design principles. The relationship among constructs is also described. These 
constructs, like cyber resiliency, can be applied at levels beyond the system (e.g., mission or 
business function level, organizational level, or sector level). Table 1 summarizes the definition 
and purpose of each construct, and how each construct is applied at the system level.

Application: Can be used to express high-level stakeholder concerns, goals, or priorities. 

OBJECTIVE 
A high-level statement (designed to be restated in system-specific and stakeholder-specific 
terms) of what a system must achieve in its operational environment and throughout its life 
cycle to meet stakeholder needs for mission assurance and resilient security. The objectives 
are more specific than goals and more relatable to threats.  

Purpose: Enable stakeholders and systems engineers to reach a common understanding of 
cyber resiliency concerns and priorities; facilitate the definition of metrics or measures of 
effectiveness (MOEs).  

Application: Used in scoring methods or summaries of analyses (e.g., cyber resiliency 
posture assessments). 

Sub-Objective 
A statement, subsidiary to a cyber resiliency objective, that emphasizes different aspects of 
that objective or identifies methods to achieve that objective.  

Purpose: Serve as a step in the hierarchical refinement of an objective into activities or 
capabilities for which performance measures can be defined. 

Application: Used in scoring methods or analyses; may be reflected in system functional 
requirements. 

Activity or Capability 
A statement of a capability or action that supports the achievement of a sub-objective and, 
hence, an objective. 

Purpose: Facilitate the definition of metrics or MOEs. While a representative set of activities 
or capabilities have been identified in [Bodeau18b], these are intended solely as a starting 
point for selection, tailoring, and prioritization.  

Application: Used in scoring methods or analyses; reflected in system functional 
requirements. 

STRATEGIC 
DESIGN PRINCIPLE 

A high-level statement that reflects an aspect of the risk management strategy that informs 
systems security engineering practices for an organization, mission, or system.  

Purpose: Guide and inform engineering analyses and risk analyses throughout the system 
life cycle. Highlight different structural design principles, cyber resiliency techniques, and 
implementation approaches.  

Application: Included, cited, or restated in system non-functional requirements (e.g., 
requirements in a Statement of Work [SOW] for analyses or documentation). 

 

21 The cyber resiliency engineering framework described in this publication is based on and consistent with the Cyber 
Resiliency Engineering Framework developed by The MITRE Corporation [Bodeau11].

2.1.1   Cyber Resiliency Goals 

Cyber resiliency, like security, is a concern at multiple levels in an organization. The four cyber 
resiliency goals, which are common to many resilience definitions, are included in the definition 
and the cyber resiliency engineering framework to provide linkage between risk management 
decisions at the system level, the mission and business process level, and the organizational 
level. Organizational risk management strategies can use cyber resiliency goals and associated 
strategies to incorporate cyber resiliency.22

For cyber resiliency engineering analysis, cyber resiliency objectives rather than goals are the 
starting point. The term adversity, as used in the cyber resiliency goals in Table 2, includes 
stealthy, persistent, sophisticated, and well-resourced adversaries (i.e., the APT) who may have 
compromised system components and established a foothold within an organization’s systems. 

TABLE 2:  CYBER RESILIENCY GOALS 

GOAL 
DESCRIPTION 

ANTICIPATE 
Maintain a state of informed preparedness for adversity. 

Discussion: Adversity refers to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on cyber 
resources. Adverse conditions can include natural disasters and structural failures (e.g., power 
failures). Stresses can include unexpectedly high-performance loads. Adversity can be caused or 
taken advantage of by an APT actor. Informed preparedness involves contingency planning, 
including plans for mitigating and investigating threat events as well as for responding to 
discoveries of vulnerabilities or supply chain compromises. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) 
provides vital information for informed preparedness. 

WITHSTAND 
Continue essential mission or business functions despite adversity. 

Discussion: Detection is not required for this goal to be meaningful and achievable. An APT 
actor’s activities may be undetected, or they may be detected but incorrectly attributed to user 
error or other stresses. The identification of essential organizational missions or business 
functions is necessary to achieve this goal. In addition, supporting processes, systems, services, 
networks, and infrastructures must also be identified. The criticality of resources and capabilities 
of essential functions can vary over time. 

RECOVER 
Restore mission or business functions during and after adversity. 

Discussion: The restoration of functions and data can be incremental. A key challenge is 
determining how much trust can be placed in restored functions and data as restoration 
progresses. Other threat events or conditions in the operational or technical environment can 
interfere with recovery, and an APT actor may seek to take advantage of confusion about 
recovery processes to establish a new foothold in the organization’s systems. 

ADAPT 
Modify mission or business functions and/or supporting capabilities in response to predicted 
changes in the technical, operational, or threat environments. 

Discussion: Change can occur at different scales and over different time frames, so tactical and 
strategic adaption may be needed. Modification can be applied to processes and procedures as 
well as technology. Changes in the technical environment can include emerging technologies 
(e.g., artificial intelligence, 5th generation mobile network [5G], Internet of Things) and the 
retirement of obsolete products. Changes in the operational environment of the organization 
can result from regulatory or policy changes, as well as the introduction of new business 
processes or workflows. Analyses of such changes and of interactions between changes can 
reveal how these could modify the attack surface or introduce fragility. 

 

2.1.2   Cyber Resiliency Objectives 

Cyber resiliency objectives23 are specific statements of what a system is intended to achieve in 
its operational environment and throughout its life cycle to meet stakeholder needs for mission 
assurance and resilient security. Cyber resiliency objectives, as described in Table 3, support 

 

23 The term objective is defined and used in multiple ways. In this document, uses are qualified (e.g., cyber resiliency 
objectives, security objectives [FIPS 199], adversary objectives [MITRE18], engineering objectives or purposes [ISO 
24765]) for clarity.

interpretation,24 facilitate prioritization and assessment, and enable development of questions 
such as: 

• 
What does each cyber resiliency objective mean in the context of the organization and the 
mission or business process that the system is intended to support? 

• 
Which cyber resiliency objectives are most important to a given stakeholder? 

• 
To what degree can each cyber resiliency objective be achieved?  

• 
How quickly and cost-effectively can each cyber resiliency objective be achieved?  

• 
With what degree of confidence or trust can each cyber resiliency objective be achieved? 

TABLE 3:  CYBER RESILIENCY OBJECTIVES25 

OBJECTIVE 
DESCRIPTION 

PREVENT OR 
AVOID 

Preclude the successful execution of an attack or the realization of adverse conditions. 

Discussion: This objective relates to an organization’s preferences for different risk response 
approaches. Risk avoidance or threat avoidance is one possible risk response approach and is 
feasible under restricted circumstances. Preventing a threat event from occurring is another 
possible risk response, similarly feasible under restricted circumstances. 

PREPARE 
Maintain a set of realistic courses of action that address predicted or anticipated adversity. 

Discussion: This objective is driven by the recognition that adversity will occur. It specifically 
relates to an organization’s contingency planning, continuity of operations plan (COOP), training, 
exercises, and incident response and recovery plans for critical systems and infrastructures. 

CONTINUE 
Maximize the duration and viability of essential mission or business functions during adversity. 

Discussion: This objective specifically relates to essential functions. Its assessment is aligned 
with the definition of performance parameters, analysis of functional dependencies, and 
identification of critical assets. Note that shared services and common infrastructures, while not 
identified as essential per se, may be necessary to essential functions and, thus, related to this 
objective. 

CONSTRAIN 
Limit damage26 from adversity. 

Discussion: This objective specifically applies to critical or high-value assets—those cyber assets 
that contain or process sensitive information, are mission-essential, or provide infrastructure 
services to mission-essential capabilities. 

RECONSTITUTE  
Restore as much mission or business functionality as possible after adversity. 

Discussion: This objective relates to essential functions, critical assets, and the services and 
infrastructures on which they depend. A key aspect of achieving this objective is ensuring that 

 

24 Cyber resiliency goals and objectives can be viewed as two levels of fundamental objectives, as used in Decision 
Theory [Clemen13]. Alternately, cyber resiliency goals can be viewed as fundamental objectives and cyber resiliency 
objectives as enabling objectives [Brtis16]. By contrast, cyber resiliency techniques can be viewed as means objectives 
[Clemen13]. 

25 See Appendix D for specific relationships between objectives and goals. 

26 From the perspective of cyber resiliency, damage can be to the organization (e.g., loss of reputation, increased 
existential risk), missions or business functions (e.g., decrease in the ability to complete the current mission and to 
accomplish future missions), security (e.g., decrease in the ability to achieve the security objectives of integrity, 
availability, and confidentiality or decrease in the ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber incidents), the 
system (e.g., decrease in the ability to meet system requirements or unauthorized use of system resources), or 
specific system elements (e.g., physical destruction; corruption, modification, or fabrication of information).

OBJECTIVE 
DESCRIPTION 

recovery, restoration, or reconstitution efforts result in trustworthy resources. This objective is 
not predicated on analysis of the source of adversity (e.g., attribution) and can be achieved even 
without detection of adversity via ongoing efforts to ensure the timely and correct availability of 
resources. 

UNDERSTAND 
Maintain useful representations of mission and business dependencies and the status of 
resources with respect to possible adversity. 

Discussion: This objective supports the achievement of all other objectives, most notably 
Prepare, Reconstitute, Transform, and Re-Architect. An organization’s plans for continuous 
diagnostics and mitigation (CDM), infrastructure services, and other services support this 
objective. The detection of anomalies, particularly suspicious or unexpected events or 
conditions, also supports achieving this objective. However, this objective includes 
understanding resource dependencies and status independent of detection. This objective also 
relates to an organization’s use of forensics and cyber threat intelligence information sharing. 

TRANSFORM 
Modify mission or business functions and supporting processes to handle adversity and address 
environmental changes more effectively. 

Discussion: This objective specifically applies to workflows for essential functions, supporting 
processes, and incident response and recovery plans for critical assets and essential functions. 
Tactical modifications are usually procedural or configuration-related; longer-term modifications 
can involve restructuring operational processes or governance responsibilities while leaving the 
underlying technical architecture unchanged. 

RE-ARCHITECT 
Modify architectures to handle adversity and address environmental changes more effectively. 

Discussion: This objective specifically applies to system architectures and mission architectures, 
which include the technical architecture of the system-of-systems supporting a mission or 
business function. In addition, this objective applies to architectures for critical infrastructures 
and services, which frequently support multiple essential functions. 

 

Because stakeholders may find the cyber resiliency objectives difficult to relate to their specific 
concerns, the objectives can be tailored to reflect the organization’s missions and business 
functions or operational concept for the system of interest. Tailoring the cyber resiliency 
objectives can also help stakeholders determine which objectives apply and the priority to 
assign to each objective. Cyber resiliency objectives can be hierarchically refined to emphasize 
the different aspects of an objective or the methods to achieve an objective, thus creating sub-
objectives.27 Cyber resiliency objectives (and sub-objectives as needed to help stakeholders 
interpret the objectives for their concerns) enable stakeholders to assert their different 
resiliency priorities based on organizational missions or business functions. 

2.1.3   Cyber Resiliency Techniques and Approaches 

Cyber resiliency goals and objectives provide a vocabulary for describing what properties and 
capabilities are needed. Cyber resiliency techniques, approaches, and design principles 
(discussed in Section 2.1.4) provide a vocabulary for discussing how a system can achieve its 
cyber resiliency goals and objectives. A cyber resiliency technique is a set or class of practices 
and technologies intended to achieve one or more goals or objectives by providing capabilities.  

 

27 Table D-1 in Appendix D provides representative examples of sub-objectives.

The following 14 techniques are part of the cyber resiliency engineering framework: 

1. Adaptive Response: Implement agile courses of action to manage risks.  

2. Analytic Monitoring: Monitor and analyze a wide range of properties and behaviors on 

an ongoing basis and in a coordinated way. 

3. Contextual Awareness: Construct and maintain current representations of the posture 

of missions or business functions while considering threat events and courses of action. 

4. Coordinated Protection: Ensure that protection mechanisms operate in a coordinated 

and effective manner. 

5. Deception: Mislead, confuse, hide critical assets from, or expose covertly tainted assets 

to the adversary. 

6. Diversity: Use heterogeneity to minimize common mode failures, particularly threat 

events exploiting common vulnerabilities. 

7. Dynamic Positioning: Distribute and dynamically relocate functionality or system 

resources. 

8. Non-Persistence: Generate and retain resources as needed or for a limited time. 

9. Privilege Restriction: Restrict privileges based on attributes of users and system 

elements, as well as on environmental factors. 

10. Realignment: Structure systems and resource uses to align with mission or business 

function needs, reduce current and anticipated risks, and accommodate the evolution of 
technical, operational, and threat environments. 

11. Redundancy: Provide multiple protected instances of critical resources. 

12. Segmentation: Define and separate system elements based on criticality and 

trustworthiness. 

13. Substantiated Integrity: Ascertain whether critical system elements have been 

corrupted. 

14. Unpredictability: Make changes randomly or unpredictably. 

The cyber resiliency techniques are described in Appendix D. Each technique is characterized by 
both the capabilities it provides and the intended consequences of using the technologies or the 
processes it includes. The cyber resiliency techniques reflect an understanding of the threats as 
well as the technologies, processes, and concepts related to improving cyber resiliency to 
address the threats. The cyber resiliency engineering framework assumes the cyber resiliency 
techniques will be selectively applied to the architecture or design of organizational mission or 
business functions and their supporting system resources. Since natural synergies and conflicts 
exist among the cyber resiliency techniques, system engineering trade-offs must be made. Cyber 
resiliency techniques are expected to change over time as threats evolve, technology advances 
are made based on research, security practices evolve, and new ideas emerge. 

Twelve of the 14 cyber resiliency techniques can be applied to adversarial or non-adversarial 
threats (including cyber-related and non-cyber-related threats). The cyber resiliency techniques 
specific to adversarial threats are Deception and Unpredictability. Cyber resiliency techniques 
are also interdependent. For example, the Analytic Monitoring technique supports Contextual

Awareness. The Unpredictability technique, however, is different from the other techniques in 
that it is always applied in conjunction with some other technique (e.g., working with the 
Dynamic Positioning technique to establish unpredictable times for repositioning potential 
targets of interest). The definitions of cyber resiliency techniques are intentionally broad to 
insulate the definitions from changing technologies and threats, thus limiting the need for 
frequent changes to the set of techniques.  

To support engineering analysis, multiple representative approaches to implementing each 
technique are identified. As illustrated in Figure 1, an implementation approach (or, for brevity, 
an approach) is a subset of the technologies and processes included in a technique that are 
defined by how the capabilities are implemented or how the intended outcomes are achieved. 

Table D-4 in Appendix D defines representative approaches and gives representative examples 
of technologies and practices. The set of approaches for a specific technique is not exhaustive 
and represents relatively mature technologies and practices. Thus, technologies emerging from 
research can be characterized in terms of the techniques they apply while not being covered by 
any of the representative approaches.28 

 

FIGURE 1:  CYBER RESILIENCY TECHNIQUES AND IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES 

 

28 Decisions about whether and how to apply less mature technologies and practices are strongly influenced by the 
organization’s risk management strategy. See [SP 800-39].

2.1.4   Cyber Resiliency Design Principles 

Systems engineers and architects use design principles29 as guidance in design decisions and 
analysis. A design principle takes the form of a terse statement or a phrase identifying a key 
concept accompanied by one or more statements that describe how that concept applies to 
system design (where “system” is broadly construed to include operational processes and 
procedures and may also include development and maintenance environments) [Bodeau17]. 
Design principles are defined for many specialty engineering disciplines using the terminology, 
experience, and research results that are specific to the specialty. 

Cyber resiliency design principles, like those from other specialty disciplines, can be applied in 
different ways at multiple stages in the system life cycle, including the operations and 
maintenance stage. The design principles can also be used in a variety of system development 
models, including agile and spiral development. The cyber resiliency design principles identified 
in this publication can serve as a starting point for systems engineers and architects. For any 
given situation, only a subset of the design principles is selected, and those principles are 
tailored or “re-expressed” in terms more meaningful to the program, system, or system-of-
systems to which they apply. 

The cyber resiliency design principles are strongly informed by and can be aligned with design 
principles from other specialty disciplines, such as the security design principles in [SP 800-160 
v1]. Many of the cyber resiliency design principles are based on design principles for security, 
resilience engineering, or both. Design principles can be characterized as strategic (i.e., applied 
throughout the systems engineering process, guiding the direction of engineering analyses) or 
structural (i.e., directly affecting the architecture and design of the system or system elements) 
[Ricci14]. Both strategic and structural cyber resiliency design principles can be reflected in 
security-related systems engineering artifacts. A complete list of strategic and structural cyber 
resiliency design principles is provided in Appendix D. 

2.1.5   Relationship Among Cyber Resiliency Constructs 

Cyber resiliency constructs, including goals, objectives, techniques, implementation approaches, 
and design principles, enable systems engineers to express cyber resiliency concepts and the 
relationships among them. The cyber resiliency constructs also relate to risk management. That 
relationship leads systems engineers to analyze cyber resiliency solutions in terms of potential 
effects on risk and on specific threat events or types of malicious cyber activities. The selection 
and relative priority of these cyber resiliency constructs is determined by the organization’s 
strategy for managing the risks of depending on systems, which include cyber resources—in 
particular, by the organization’s risk framing.30 The relative priority of the cyber resiliency goals 
and objectives and relevance of the cyber resiliency design principles are determined by the risk 

 

29 As described in [Bodeau17], a design principle refers to distillations of experience designing, implementing, 
integrating, and upgrading systems. 

30 The first component of risk management addresses how organizations frame risk or establish a risk context—that 
is, describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made. The purpose of the risk-framing component is 
to produce a risk management strategy that addresses how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and 
monitor risk—making explicit and transparent the risk perceptions that organizations routinely use in making both 
investment and operational decisions [SP 800-39]. The risk management strategy addresses how the organization 
manages the risks of depending on systems that include cyber resources; is part of a comprehensive, enterprise-wide 
risk management strategy; and reflects stakeholder concerns and priorities.

management strategy of the organization, which takes into consideration the concerns of, 
constraints on, and equities of all stakeholders (including those who are not part of the 
organization). Figure 2 illustrates the relationships among the cyber resiliency constructs. These 
relationships are represented by mapping tables in Appendix D. As Figure 2 illustrates, a cyber-
resilient system is the result of the engineering selection, prioritization, and application of cyber 
resiliency design principles, techniques, and implementation approaches. The risk management 
strategy for the organization is translated into specific interpretations and prioritizations of 
cyber resiliency goals and objectives, which guide and inform trade-offs among different forms 
of risk mitigation.

and design principles can impact systems at key stages in the life cycle. Figure 3 lists the system 
life cycle processes and illustrates their application across all stages of the system life cycle. It 
must be emphasized, however, that cyber resiliency engineering does not assume any specific 
life cycle or system development process, and cyber resiliency analysis can be performed at any 
point in and iteratively throughout the life cycle.32 

 

 

FIGURE 3:  SYSTEM LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES AND LIFE CYCLE STAGES 

Cyber resiliency constructs are interpreted and cyber resiliency engineering practices are 
applied in different ways depending on the system life cycle stages. During the Concept stage, 
cyber resiliency goals and objectives are tailored in terms of the concept of use for the system of 
interest. Tailoring actions are used to elicit stakeholder priorities for the cyber resiliency goals 
and objectives. The organization’s risk management strategy is used to help determine which 
strategic design principles are most relevant. The strategic design principles and corresponding 
structural design principles are aligned with design principles from other specialty engineering 
disciplines. Notional or candidate system architectures are analyzed with respect to how well 
the prioritized cyber resiliency goals and objectives can be achieved and how well the relevant 
strategic cyber resiliency design principles can be applied. The tailoring of objectives can also be

used to identify or define potential metrics or measures of effectiveness for proposed cyber 
resiliency solutions. Once again, the risk management strategy that constrains risk response or 
risk treatment (e.g., commitment to specific technologies, requirements for interoperability with 
or dependence on other systems) is used to help determine which techniques and approaches 
can or cannot be used in cyber resiliency solutions. In addition, during the Concept stage, cyber 
resiliency concerns for enabling systems for production, integration, validation, and supply chain 
management are identified, and strategies for addressing those concerns are defined. 

During the Development stage, the relevant structural cyber resiliency design principles (i.e., 
those principles that can be applied to the selected system architecture and that support the 
strategic cyber resiliency design principles) are identified and prioritized based on how well the 
design principles enable the prioritized cyber resiliency objectives to be achieved. The cyber 
resiliency techniques and approaches indicated by the structural design principles are analyzed 
with respect to whether and where they can be used in the selected system architecture given 
the constraints identified earlier. Cyber resiliency solutions are defined and analyzed with 
respect to potential effectiveness and compatibility with other aspects of trustworthiness.  

Analysis of potential effectiveness considers the relative effectiveness of the solution against 
potential threat events or scenarios [SP 800-30] and the measures of effectiveness for cyber 
resiliency objectives. Analysis of compatibility with other aspects of trustworthiness considers 
potential synergies or conflicts associated with technologies, design principles, or practices 
specific to other specialty engineering disciplines, particularly security, reliability, survivability, 
and safety. In addition, specific measures for assessing whether or not the prerequisite 
requirements have been satisfied within the solution space are defined. This may include, for 
example, a determination of the baseline reliability of the technology components needed to 
deliver cyber-resilient capabilities within a system element. 

In addition, during the Development stage, the implementation of cyber resiliency solutions is 
analyzed and evaluated. The verification strategy for cyber resiliency solutions at this stage 
typically includes adversarial testing or demonstration of mission or business function measures 
of performance in a stressed environment with adversarial activities. The operational processes 
and procedures for using technical solutions are defined, refined, and validated with respect to 
the ability to meet mission and business objectives despite the adversity involving systems 
containing cyber resources. The cyber resiliency perspective calls for testing and other forms of 
validation or verification that include adversarial threats among (and in combination with) other 
stresses on the system. During this life cycle stage, resources (e.g., diverse implementations of 
critical system elements, alternative processing facilities) required to implement specific courses 
of action are also developed. 

During the Production stage, the verification strategy is applied to instances or versions of the 
system of interest and associated spare parts or components. The verification strategy for the 
cyber resiliency requirements as applied to such instances and system elements includes 
adversarial testing or demonstration in a stressed environment. In addition, during the 
Production stage, cyber resiliency concerns for enabling systems for production, integration, 
validation, and supply chain management continue to be identified and addressed. 

During the Utilization stage, the effectiveness of cyber resiliency solutions in the operational 
environment is monitored. Effectiveness may decrease due to changes in the operational

environment (e.g., new mission or business processes, new stakeholders, increased user 
population, configuration drift, deployment in new locations, addition or removal of systems or 
system elements with which the system of interest interacts), the threat environment (e.g., new 
threat actors, new vulnerabilities in commonly used technologies), or the technical environment 
(e.g., the introduction of new technologies into other systems with which the system of interest 
interacts). Cyber resiliency solutions may need to be adapted to address such changes (e.g., 
defining new courses of action, reconfiguring system elements, changing mission or business 
processes and procedures). The relative priorities of cyber resiliency objectives may shift based 
on changes to stakeholders, stakeholder concerns, mission or business processes, or project 
funding. Finally, changes in the threat or technical environment may make some techniques or 
approaches less feasible, while changes in the technical or operational environment may make 
others more viable.  

During the Support stage, maintenance and upgrade of the system or system elements can 
include integration of new cyber resiliency solutions into the system of interest. This stage also 
provides opportunities to revisit the prioritization and tailoring of cyber resiliency objectives. 
Upgrades to or modifications of system capabilities can include significant architectural changes 
that address accumulated changes to the operational, threat, and technical environments. 
System modifications and upgrades can also introduce additional vulnerabilities, particularly 
with architectural changes. 

During the Retirement stage, system elements or the entire system of interest are removed 
from operations. The retirement process can affect other systems with which the system of 
interest interacts and can decrease the cyber resiliency of those systems and of the supported 
mission or business processes. Retirement strategies can include phased removal of system 
elements, turnkey removal of all system elements, phased replacement of system elements, and 
turnkey replacement of the entire system of interest. Cyber resiliency objectives and priorities 
are identified for the systems, missions, and business functions in the operational environment 
to inform analysis of the potential or expected effects of different retirement strategies on the 
ability to achieve those objectives. Like the support stage, the retirement stage can introduce 
significant vulnerabilities, particularly during disposal and unintended residue remaining from 
decommissioned assets.33 

Table 4 illustrates changes in emphasis for the different cyber resiliency constructs, particularly 
with respect to cyber resiliency objectives (bolded).

2.3   RISK MANAGEMENT AND CYBER RESILIENCY 

Organizations manage the missions, business functions, and operational risks related to 
dependencies on systems that include cyber resources as part of a larger portfolio of risks,34  
including financial and reputational risks; programmatic or project-related risks associated with 
developing a system (e.g., cost, schedule, performance); security risks associated with the 
organization’s mission or business activities, information the organization processes or handles, 
or requirements arising from legislation, regulations, policies, or standards; and cybersecurity 
risks. A proposed cyber resiliency solution, while intended primarily to reduce mission, business, 
or operational risk, can also reduce other types of risk (e.g., security risk, reputational risk, 
supply chain risk, performance risk). However, like any solution to a risk management problem, 
it can also increase other types of risk (e.g., financial, cost, or schedule risk). As part of a 
multidisciplinary systems engineering effort, systems security engineers and risk management 
professionals are responsible for articulating the potential adverse impacts of alternative 
solutions, determining whether those impacts fall within the organizational risk tolerance, 
deciding whether the adoption of a proposed solution is consistent with the organization’s risk 
management strategy, and informing the organization’s risk executive of risk trade-offs.35 

At the organizational level, a cyber resiliency perspective on risk management can lead to the 
analysis and management of risks associated with programs and initiatives at multiple levels, 
which involve investment in, transition to, use of, or transition away from different cyber 
technologies. The environment in which a system of interest is engineered is rarely static. 
Related programs, initiatives, or other efforts at federal agencies, driven by [EO 14028], can 
include efforts to transition to a zero trust architecture, reduce software supply chain risks, and 

 

34 These risks are typically addressed by organizations as part of an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. See 
[IR 8286].

transition from IPv4 to IPv6. Such organization-level programs and initiatives can affect the 
execution of efforts at lower levels (e.g., an acquisition program for a specific system or service, 
an initiative to redefine a mission or business process to better accommodate telework). 

Motivated by the cyber resiliency Adapt goal, an organization’s risk management strategy can 
also consider the following questions: 

• 
How does each step in a transition plan or an investment plan change the attack surface? 

• 
Are new attack vectors enabled by a given step? How will they be mitigated? Will they be 
removed in a later step? 

• 
Does this step increase fragility, complexity, or instability? If so, how will those risks be 
managed? 

• 
On what other programs or initiatives does this step depend? If those efforts do not achieve 
the expected objectives, how will the risks be managed? 

• 
What new or modified operational procedures and processes are assumed? How will they 
be resourced and staffed? 

• 
What policy or governance changes are assumed? How will they be achieved? What risks 
would result if they are not achieved? 

• 
How will the cyber resiliency objectives (as interpreted and prioritized by the organization) 
continue to be achieved in the face of changes resulting from different programs and 
initiatives?  

 

 

 
 
 

GENERALIZED CYBER RESILIENCY CONSTRUCTS 

Cyber resiliency goals, objectives, and techniques are generally defined so they can be applied 
to all types of threats (not solely cyber threats) and all types of systems (not solely systems that 
include or are enabled by cyber resources). However, the motivation for these definitions and 
for the selection of objectives and techniques for inclusion in the cyber resiliency engineering 
framework is the recognition of dependence on systems involving cyber resources in a threat 
environment that includes the APT.

CYBER RESILIENCY IN THE SYSTEM LIFE CYCLE 

NIST is working with the United States Air Force and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to 
explore ways to incorporate the cyber resiliency constructs in this publication into the system 
development life cycle through the use of automated support tools. The use of such tools can 
help ensure that cyber resiliency requirements are clearly defined and more easily integrated 
into the system development life cycle. Automated tools can provide an efficient and effective 
vehicle for incorporating cyber resiliency capabilities into a variety of systems (e.g., weapons 
systems, space systems, command and control systems, industrial control systems, enterprise IT 
systems) using any established life cycle development process or approach (e.g., agile, waterfall, 
spiral, DevOps). Automation can also support the rapid testing and evaluation of cyber resiliency 
capabilities in critical systems to reduce the time to operational deployment.

CHAPTER THREE 

CYBER RESILIENCY IN PRACTICE 
APPLYING CYBER RESILIENCY CONCEPTS, CONSTRUCTS, PRACTICES 

his chapter identifies considerations for determining which cyber resiliency constructs are 
most relevant to a system of interest and describes a tailorable process for applying cyber 
resiliency concepts, constructs, and practices to a system. It also includes guidance on the 
cyber resiliency analysis carried out during the system life cycle to determine whether the cyber 
resiliency properties and behaviors of a system of interest, regardless of its life cycle stage, are 
sufficient for the organization using that system to meet its mission assurance, business 
continuity, or other security requirements in a threat environment and contested cyberspace 
that includes the APT. 

3.1   SELECTING AND PRIORITIZING CYBER RESILIENCY CONSTRUCTS 

The variety of concerns, technologies, and practices related to cyber resiliency results in an 
extensive framework for cyber resiliency engineering. For example, the engineering framework 
identifies 14 cyber resiliency techniques and 50 cyber resiliency implementation approaches. 
The engineering framework is also complex, with relationships among the constructs of goals, 
objectives, design principles, techniques, and approaches, as discussed in Appendix D. Cyber 
resiliency design principles, techniques, and approaches build on, complement, or function in 
synergy with mechanisms intended to ensure other quality properties (e.g., security, safety, and 
system resilience). 

The variety of circumstances and types of systems for which cyber resiliency can be applied 
means that no single cyber resiliency technique, approach, or set of approaches is universally 
optimal or applicable. Systems security engineering seeks to manage risk rather than provide a 
universal solution. The choice of a risk-appropriate set of cyber resiliency techniques and 
approaches depends on various trade space considerations and risk factors that are assessed 
during the systems engineering processes. Employment of all cyber resiliency techniques and 
approaches is not needed to achieve the cyber resiliency objectives prioritized by stakeholders. 
In fact, it is not possible to employ all techniques and approaches simultaneously. The following 
subsections describe factors to consider when selecting a set of cyber resiliency techniques and 
implementation approaches that best fits the system of interest. 

3.1.1   Achievement of Goals and Objectives 

Cyber resiliency techniques and associated implementation approaches are employed to 
achieve mission or business objectives. The relative priorities of cyber resiliency goals and 
objectives are determined by the mission or business objectives. The selection of specific cyber 
resiliency techniques and approaches is, therefore, driven in part by the relative priorities of the 
objectives they support.36

3.1.2   Cyber Risk Management Strategy 

An organization’s cyber risk management strategy (i.e., its strategy for managing risks stemming 
from dependencies on systems that include cyber resources) is part of its risk management 
strategy and includes its risk framing for cyber risks.37 The organization’s risk frame identifies 
which risks or risk factors (i.e., potential impacts or consequences) are unacceptable. For cyber 
resiliency, the risk frame assumes an adversary with a persistent presence in organizational 
systems. The risk response portion of the risk management strategy can include priorities or 
preferences for the types of effects on adversary activities38 to seek in cyber resiliency solutions. 

An organization’s risk management strategy is constrained by such factors as legal, regulatory, 
and contractual requirements as reflected in organizational policies and procedures, financial 
resources, legacy investments, and organizational culture. These constraints imply the need to 
consider the costs, ease of use, and operational impacts of security and cyber resiliency 
solutions. The constraints can be reflected in the selection and tailoring of cyber resiliency 
techniques, approaches, and design principles. For example, organizational policies and culture 
can influence whether and how the cyber resiliency technique of Deception is used. The risk 
management strategy can define an order of precedence for responding to identified risks 
analogous to the safety order of precedence, such as “harden, sensor, isolate, obfuscate.” 
Together with the strategic design principles selected and specifically tailored to a given 
program, mission, business function, or system, the order of precedence can guide the selection 
and application of structural design principles at different locations in an architecture.39 

3.1.3   System Type 

The set of cyber resiliency techniques and approaches that are most relevant to and useful in a 
system depends on the type of system. The following present some general examples of system 
types and the techniques and approaches that might be appropriate for those types of systems. 
In addition to the techniques and approaches listed in the examples below, there may be other 
techniques and approaches that could be useful for a particular type of system. The specific 
aspects of the system in question will impact the selection as well. 

• 
Enterprise IT Systems, Shared Services, and Common Infrastructures 

Enterprise IT (EIT) systems are typically general-purpose computing systems—very often 
with significant processing, storage, and bandwidth—capable of delivering information 
resources that can meet the business or other mission needs of an enterprise or a large 
stakeholder community. As such, all of the cyber resiliency techniques and associated 
approaches may potentially be viable, although their selection would depend on the other 
considerations noted in this section. 

 

 

37 Risk management consists of four major components: risk framing, risk assessment, risk response, and risk 
monitoring [SP 800-39]. Security risks are considered throughout an organization’s enterprise risk management (ERM) 
process. This includes identifying the risk context; identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks; planning and executing 
risk response strategies; and monitoring, evaluating, and adjusting risk [IR 8286]. Risk response is also referred to as 
risk treatment [SP 800-160 v1] [ISO 73]. Organizational risk tolerance is determined as part of the risk framing 
component and defined in the risk management strategy [SP 800-39].

• 
Large-Scale Processing Environments  

Large-scale processing environments (LSPEs) handle large numbers of events and data (e.g., 
process transactions) with high confidence in service delivery. The scale of such systems 
makes them highly sensitive to disruptions to or degradation of service. Therefore, the 
selective use of the Offloading and Restriction implementations approaches can make the 
scale of such systems more manageable. This, in turn, will support the application of 
Analytic Monitoring and the Mission Dependency and Status Visualization approach to 
Contextual Awareness in a manner that does not significantly affect performance. LSPEs 
often implement Dynamic Positioning functionality that can be repurposed to help improve 
cyber resiliency via the Functional Relocation of Cyber Resources, Fragmentation, and 
Distributed Functionality approaches. 

• 
System-of-Systems 

Many cyber resiliency techniques are likely to be applicable to a system-of-systems, but 
some techniques and approaches can offer greater benefits than others. For example, 
Contextual Awareness implemented via Mission Dependency and Status Visualization can be 
applied to predict the potential mission impacts of cyber effects of adversary activities on 
constituent systems or system elements. The Calibrated Defense-in-Depth and Consistency 
Analysis approaches to the technique of Coordinated Protection can help ensure that the 
disparate protections of the constituent systems operate consistently and in a coordinated 
manner to prevent or delay the advance of an adversary across those systems. For a system-
of-systems involving constituent systems that were not designed to work together and that 
were developed with different missions, functions, and risk frames, Realignment could also 
be beneficial. In particular, the Offloading and Restriction approaches could be used to 
ensure that the core system elements are appropriately aligned to the overall system-of-
system mission. 

• 
Critical Infrastructure Systems 

Critical infrastructure systems are often specialized, high confidence, dedicated, purpose-
built systems that have highly deterministic properties. Therefore, the availability and 
integrity of the functionality of the systems are very important as the corruption or lack of 
availability of some of the key system elements could result in significant harm. For these 
reasons, techniques adapted from system resilience, such as Redundancy (particularly the 
Protected Backup and Restore and Surplus Capacity approaches) coupled with aspects of 
Diversity (e.g., Architectural Diversity, Supply Chain Diversity), could prevent attacks from 
having mission or business consequences and also maximize the chance of continuation of 
the critical or essential mission or business operations. Segmentation can isolate highly 
critical system elements to protect them from an adversary’s activities. Approaches such as 
Trust-Based Privilege Management and Attribute-Based Usage Restriction could constrain 
the potential damage that an adversary could inflict on a system. 

• 
Cyber-Physical Systems 

As with critical infrastructure systems, cyber-physical systems (CPS) may have limitations 
regarding storage capacity, processing capabilities, and bandwidth. In addition, many of 
these systems have a high degree of autonomy with limited human interaction. Some cyber-
physical systems operate with no active network connection, although they may connect to 
a network under specific circumstances (e.g., scheduled maintenance). Non-Persistent

Services support the periodic refreshing of software and firmware from a trusted source 
(e.g., an offline redundant component), in effect flushing out any malware. However, that 
approach applies only if the organization can allow for the periodic downtime that the 
refresh would entail. Similarly, the Integrity Checks approach to Substantiated Integrity 
implemented via cryptographic checksums on critical software could help enable embedded 
systems to detect corrupted software components. 

• 
Internet of Things 

An Internet of Things (IoT) system consists of system elements with network connectivity 
and that communicate with an Internet-accessible software application. That software 
application, which is part of the IoT system, orchestrates the behavior of or aggregates the 
data provided by constituent system elements. The system elements have limitations in the 
areas of power consumption, processing, storage capacity, and bandwidth, which in turn 
may limit the potential for such processing-intensive cyber resiliency approaches such as 
Obfuscation or Adaptive Management at the device level. Because many “things” (e.g., light 
bulbs, door locks) are small and relatively simple, they often lack the capacity for basic 
protection. However, the Integrity Checks approach to Substantiated Integrity could still be 
viable when applied in conjunction with reliability mechanisms. An IoT system assumes 
Internet connectivity, although the set of “things” is usually capable of functioning 
independently if not connected. Because many IoT systems do not assume technical 
expertise on the part of users, cyber resiliency techniques and approaches that involve 
human interaction (e.g., Disinformation, Misdirection) may not be appropriate. In addition, 
the design of IoT systems accommodates flexibility and repurposing of the capabilities of 
constituent “things.” Thus, an application that orchestrated the behavior of one set of 
“things” may be upgraded to orchestrate additional sets, the members of which were not 
designed with that application in mind. Such changes to the IoT systems to which that 
application or the additional sets originally belong can benefit from the application of 
Realignment. At the level of an IoT system (rather than at the level of individual system 
elements), Segmentation and Consistency Analysis can be applied.  

3.1.4   Cyber Resiliency Conflicts and Synergies 

Cyber resiliency techniques can interact in several ways. One technique can depend on another 
so that the first cannot be implemented without the second; for example, Adaptive Response 
depends on Analytic Monitoring or Contextual Awareness since a response requires a stimulus. 
One technique can support another, making the second more effective; for example, Diversity 
and Redundancy are mutually supportive. One technique can use another so that more design 
options are available than if the techniques were applied independently; for example, Analytic 
Monitoring can use Diversity in a design, which includes a diverse set of monitoring tools. 

However, one technique can also conflict with or complicate the use of another. For example, 
Diversity and Segmentation can each make Analytic Monitoring and Contextual Awareness more 
difficult. A design that incorporates Diversity requires monitoring tools that can handle the 
diverse set of system elements, while implementation of Segmentation can limit the visibility of 
such tools. By selecting techniques in accordance with the risk management strategy and design 
principles, synergies and conflicts between various techniques are taken into consideration. The 
text below offers three illustrative examples of the interplay, focusing on the techniques that 
increase an adversary’s work factor.

As a first example, Dynamic Positioning and Non-Persistence enable operational agility by 
making it more difficult for an adversary to target critical resources. These techniques support 
the Continue, Constrain, and Reconstitute objectives and are part of applying the Support agility 
and architect for adaptability strategic design principle and the Change or disrupt the attack 
surface structural design principle. At the same time, these techniques (and the associated 
implementation approaches) also make it more difficult for an organization to maintain 
situational awareness of its security posture. That is, Dynamic Positioning and Non-Persistence 
complicate the use of Contextual Awareness and aspects of Analytic Monitoring and, thus, can 
conflict with the Maintain situational awareness structural design principle.  

As a second example, Redundancy and Diversity together are effective at resisting adversary 
attacks. These techniques enhance the system’s ability to achieve the Continue and Reconstitute 
objectives and apply the Plan and manage diversity and Maintain redundancy structural design 
principles. However, the implementation of both Redundancy and Diversity will increase the 
system’s attack surface.  

As a final example, Deception can lead the adversary to waste effort and reveal tactics, 
techniques, and procedures (TTP), but it can also complicate the use of aspects of Analytic 
Monitoring and Contextual Awareness. In general, while Redundancy, Diversity, Deception, 
Dynamic Positioning, and Unpredictability will likely greatly increase the adversary work factor, 
they come at a cost to some other cyber resiliency objectives, techniques, and design principles.  

No technique or set of techniques is optimal with respect to all decision factors. There are 
always ramifications for employing any given technique. The determination of the appropriate 
selection of techniques is a trade decision that systems engineers make considering all relevant 
factors. A more complete identification of potential interactions (e.g., synergies and conflicts) 
between cyber resiliency techniques is presented in Table D-3. 

3.1.5   Other Disciplines and Existing Investments 

Many of the techniques and implementation approaches that support cyber resiliency are well 
established. Some technologies or processes are drawn from other disciplines (e.g., Continuity 
of Operations [COOP], cybersecurity) but are used or executed in a different manner to support 
cyber resiliency. These include Adaptive Response, Analytic Monitoring, Coordinated Protection, 
Privilege Restriction, Redundancy, and Segmentation. Others are drawn from disciplines that 
deal with non-adversarial threats (e.g., safety, reliability). These include Contextual Awareness, 
Diversity, Non-Persistence, Realignment, and Substantiated Integrity. Still others are cyber 
adaptations of non-cyber concepts drawn from disciplines that deal with adversarial threats 
(e.g., medicine, military/defense, sports). These include Deception, Dynamic Positioning, and 
Unpredictability. Legacy investments made by an organization in these other disciplines can 
influence which cyber resiliency techniques and approaches are most appropriate to pursue.  

3.1.5.1   Investments from Cybersecurity, COOP, and Resilience Engineering 

Redundancy-supporting approaches—such as backup, surplus capacity, and replication—are 
well established in COOP programs. From a cyber resiliency perspective, however, these 
approaches are not sufficient to protect against the APT. A threat actor might choose to target 
backup servers as optimum locations to implant malware if those servers are not sufficiently 
protected. In addition, remote backup servers that employ the same architecture as the primary

server are vulnerable to malware that has compromised the primary server. However, if an 
organization has already invested in backup services (in support of COOP or cybersecurity), 
those services can be enhanced by requiring an adversary to navigate multiple distinct defenses, 
authentication challenges (Calibrated Defense-in-Depth approach to Coordinated Protection), or 
some form of Synthetic Diversity to compensate for known attack vectors. 

Contextual Awareness and Analytic Monitoring capabilities are often provided by performance 
management and cybersecurity functions, including cyber situational awareness, anomaly 
detection, and performance monitoring. However, the off-the-shelf implementations of these 
functions are generally insufficient to detect threats from advanced adversaries. Enhancing 
existing investments in both detection and monitoring by integrating data from sensor and 
monitor readings from disparate sources is a way to take these existing investments and make 
them an effective cyber resiliency tool. Another way to make existing technology more cyber-
resilient is to complement the existing monitoring services with information from threat 
intelligence sources, enabling these tools to be better tuned to look for known observables (e.g., 
indicators of adversary TTPs). 

Some approaches to Segmentation and Coordinated Protection appear in information security 
or cybersecurity. Predefined Segmentation, as reflected in boundary demilitarized zones 
(DMZs), is a well-established construct in cybersecurity. One important distinction of cyber 
resiliency is that the segmentation is applied throughout the system, not just at the system 
boundary. In addition, the Dynamic Segmentation and Isolation approach allows for changing 
the placement and/or activation of the protected segments. For Coordinated Protection, the 
defense-in-depth approach is often used for security or system resilience. Ensuring that those 
protections work in a coordinated fashion is one of the distinguishing aspects of cyber resiliency. 

3.1.5.2   Investments from Non-Adversarial Disciplines 

Some cyber resiliency techniques and approaches come from disciplines such as safety or 
performance management. Diversity and certain implementations of Substantiated Integrity, 
such as Byzantine quorum systems40 or checksums on critical software, can be traced back to 
the safety discipline.41 Therefore, systems that have been designed with safety in mind may 
already have implemented some of these capabilities. However, the safety capabilities were 
designed with the assumption that they were countering non-adversarial threat events. To 
make these capabilities useful against the APT, certain changes are needed. From a safety 
perspective, it may be sufficient to only employ checksums that are polynomial hash-based (e.g., 
a cyclic redundancy check used to detect accidental changes) on critical software to ensure that 
the software has not been corrupted over time. However, such checksums are not sufficient 
when dealing with the APT, which is able to corrupt the software and data and then recalculate 
or even construct the modified data to duplicate the original checksum. Instead, what is needed 
in those instances are checksums generated by cryptographic-based secure hash functions that 
are also cryptographically signed so that they fulfill Integrity Checks and Provenance Tracking to 
a specified cryptographic strength. 

 

40 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Shuttle Program applied this concept in multiple 
computers, which would vote on certain maneuvers. 

41 This is an example of operational redundancy where specific failure modes are managed as part of the nominal 
operation of the system. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) storage systems and “hyper-converged” 
computing architectures (i.e., those relying on erasure code for distributed data stores) also fall into this category.

Other capabilities such as Non-Persistence and Adaptive Response are very common in cloud 
and virtualization architectures. Again, these capabilities were not designed or employed to 
specifically counter the APT but to facilitate the rapid deployment of implementations. From a 
system design and implementation perspective, it is easier to employ existing virtualization 
technology and change the criteria of when and why to refresh critical services (e.g., periodically 
refresh the software and firmware with the goal of flushing out malware) than it is to deploy 
Non-Persistence in a system that cannot implement the capability. 

3.1.5.3   Investments from Adversarial Disciplines 

Several of the cyber resiliency techniques and approaches are cyber adaptions of non-cyber 
methods used in adversary-oriented disciplines (e.g., medicine, military, sports). These include 
the Deception, Unpredictability, and Dynamic Positioning techniques and the Dynamic Threat 
Awareness and Evolvability approaches. None of those techniques or approaches are used in 
non-adversarial disciplines. There is no reason in resilience engineering to attempt to “mislead” 
a hurricane, nor is there any benefit in safety engineering to include an element of purposeful 
unpredictability. The value of these constructs in non-cyber environments is well established. 
Because these adversarial-derived techniques and approaches are not typically found in 
disciplines such as safety, resilience engineering, or COOP, it is much more challenging to 
provide them by enhancing existing constructs. Therefore, they may be more challenging to 
integrate into an existing system. 

3.1.6   Architectural Locations 

The selection of cyber resiliency techniques or approaches depends, in part, on where (i.e., at 
what layers, to which components or system elements, at which interfaces between layers or 
system elements) in the system architecture cyber resiliency solutions can be applied. The set of 
layers, like the set of system components or system elements, in an architecture depends on the 
type of system. For example, an embedded system offers a different set of possible locations 
than an enterprise architecture that includes applications running in a cloud. The set of layers 
can include an operational (people-and-processes) layer, a support layer (e.g., programmatic, 
systems engineering, maintenance, and sustainment), and a layer to represent the physical 
environment. 

Different cyber resiliency techniques or approaches lend themselves to implementation at 
different architectural layers.42 Some approaches can be implemented at multiple layers in 
different ways and with varying degrees of maturity. Other approaches are highly specific to a 
layer; for example, Asset Mobility is implemented in the operations layer or in the physical 
environment. For some layers, many approaches may be applicable; for others, relatively few 
approaches may be available. For example, relatively few approaches can be implemented at 
the hardware layer. These include Dynamic Reconfiguration, Architectural Diversity, Design 
Diversity, Replication, Predefined Segmentation, and Integrity Checks.  

Similarly, some cyber resiliency approaches lend themselves to specific types of components or 
system elements. For example, Fragmentation applies to information stores. Some approaches 
assume that a system element or set of system elements has been included in the architecture 
specifically to support cyber defense. These include Dynamic Threat Awareness, Forensic and

Behavioral Analysis, and Misdirection. Other cyber resiliency approaches assume that a system 
element has been included in the architecture, explicitly or virtually, to support the mission, 
security, or business operations. These include Sensor Fusion and Analysis, Consistency Analysis, 
Orchestration, and all of the approaches to Privilege Restriction. 

Finally, some techniques or approaches lend themselves to implementation at interfaces 
between layers or between system elements. These include Segmentation, Monitoring and 
Damage Assessment, and Behavior Validation. 

3.1.7   Effects on Adversaries, Threats, and Risks 

The selection of cyber resiliency techniques and approaches can be motivated by potential 
effects on adversary activities or on risk. Two resiliency techniques or approaches listed as both 
potentially having the same effect may differ in how strongly that effect applies to a given threat 
event, scope (i.e., the set of threat events for which the effect is or can be produced), and 
affected risk factors. For example, all approaches to Non-Persistence can degrade an adversary’s 
ability to maintain a covert presence via the malicious browser extension TTP; closing the 
browser session when it is no longer needed, a use of Non-Persistent Services, degrades the 
adversary’s activity more than other Non-Persistence approaches do. Some techniques or 
approaches will affect more risk factors (e.g., reduce the likelihood of impact or reduce the level 
of impact) than others. The security mechanisms or processes used to implement a particular 
cyber resiliency approach will also vary with respect to their scope and strength. For example, a 
Misdirection approach to the Deception technique, implemented via a deception net, and the 
Sensor Fusion and Analysis approach to Analytic Monitoring, implemented via a holistic suite of 
intrusion detection systems, will both achieve the detect effect. However, the effectiveness and 
scope of the two vary widely. For this reason, engineering trade-offs among techniques, 
approaches, and implementations should consider the actual effects to be expected in the 
context of the system’s architecture, design, and operational environment. 

In general, systems security engineering decisions seek to provide as complete a set of effects as 
possible and to maximize those effects with the recognition that this optimization problem will 
not have a single solution. The rationale for selecting cyber resiliency techniques or approaches 
that have complete coverage of the potential effects relates to the long-term nature of the 
threat campaigns. Potentially, engagements with the APT may go on for months, if not years, 
possibly starting while a system is in development or even earlier in the life cycle. Given the 
nature of the threat, its attacks will likely evolve over time in response to a defender’s actions. 
Having a selection of techniques and approaches—where each technique and approach 
supports (to different degrees and in different ways) multiple effects on the adversary, and the 
union of the techniques and approaches allows for all potential effects on an adversary—
provides the systems engineers with the flexibility to evolve and tailor the effects to the 
adversary’s changing actions. This is analogous to team sports where a team will change its 
game plan in response to player injuries and the changing game plan of the other team. A team 
with players who can play multiple positions gives it the flexibility to respond to changes by the 
opposition and to potentially replace injured players. 

Different cyber resiliency techniques and approaches can have different effects on threat events 
and risk. No single technique or approach can create all possible effects on a threat event, and 
no technique or approach or set of techniques or approaches can eliminate risk. However, by

CHAPTER THREE

considering the desired effects, systems engineers can select a set of techniques that will 
collectively achieve those effects.43 

3.1.8   Maturity and Potential Adoption 

Approaches to applying cyber resiliency techniques vary in maturity and adoption. The decision 
to use less mature technologies depends on the organization’s risk management strategy and its 
strategy for managing technical risks. Many highly mature and widely adopted technologies and 
processes that were developed to meet the general needs of performance, dependability, or 
security can be used or repurposed to address cyber resiliency concerns. These pose little, if any, 
technical risk. Changes in operational processes, procedures, and configuration changes may be 
needed to make these technologies and processes effective against the APT and, thus, part of 
cyber resiliency solutions.  

A growing number of technologies are specifically oriented toward cyber resiliency, including 
moving target defenses and deception toolkits. These technologies are currently focused on 
enterprise IT environments. As these technologies become more widely adopted, the decision 
to include the technologies is influenced more by policy than by technical risk considerations. 
This is particularly the case for applications of the Deception and Unpredictability cyber 
resiliency techniques. 

Cyber resiliency is an active research area. Technologies are being explored to improve the 
cyber resiliency of cyber-physical systems, high-confidence, dedicated-purpose systems, and 
large-scale processing environments. The integration of solutions involving new technologies to 
reduce risks due to the APT should be balanced against risks associated with perturbing such 
systems. 

3.2   ANALYTIC PRACTICES AND PROCESSES 

In the context of systems security engineering, cyber resiliency analysis is intended to determine 
whether the cyber resiliency properties and behaviors of a system of interest, regardless of its 
system life cycle stage, are sufficient for the organization using that system to meet its mission 
assurance, business continuity, or other security requirements in a threat environment that 
includes the APT. Cyber resiliency analysis is performed with the expectation that such analysis 
will support systems engineering and risk management decisions about the system of interest. 
Depending on the life cycle stage, programmatic considerations, and other factors discussed 
above, a cyber resiliency analysis could recommend architectural changes, the integration of 
new products or technologies into the system, changes in how existing products or technologies 
are used, or changes in operating procedures or environmental protections consistent with and 
designed to implement the organization’s risk management strategy.  

The following subsections describe a general, tailorable process for cyber resiliency analysis 
consisting of steps and tasks, as summarized in Table 5. A variety of motivations for a cyber 
resiliency analysis are possible, including ensuring that cyber risks due to the APT are fully 
considered as part of the RMF process or other risk management process, supporting systems 
security engineering tasks, and recalibrating assessments of risk and risk responses based on 
information about new threats (e.g., information about a cyber incident or an APT actor), newly

discovered vulnerabilities (e.g., discovery of a common design flaw), and problematic 
dependencies (e.g., discovery of a supply chain issue). Although described in terms of a broad 
analytic scope, the process can be tailored to have a narrow scope, such as analyzing the 
potential cyber resiliency improvement that could be achieved by integrating a specific 
technology or identifying ways to ensure adequate cyber resiliency against a specific threat 
scenario.  

The analytic processes and practices related to cyber resiliency are intended to be integrated 
with those for other specialty engineering disciplines, including security, systems engineering, 
resilience engineering, safety, cybersecurity, and mission assurance.44 In addition, analytic 
processes and practices related to cyber resiliency can leverage system representations offered 
by model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and analytic methods (including those involving 
artificial intelligence [AI] and machine learning [ML]) integrated into MBSE. Cyber resiliency 
analysis, like other types of engineering analysis (e.g., safety, security), should be performed 
repeatedly throughout the life cycle as changes arise in the operational, technical, and threat 
environments. 

A variety of artifacts can provide information used in a cyber resiliency analysis depending on its 
scope, the life cycle stage of the system or systems within the scope of the analysis, the step in 
the RMF of the in-scope system or systems, the extent to which the organization relying on the 
system or systems has done contingency planning, and (for systems in the Utilization life cycle 
stage) reports on security posture and incident response. These artifacts can include engineering 
project plans, system security plans, supply chain risk management plans [SP 800-161], reports 
on security posture [SP 800-37], penetration test results, contingency plans [SP 800-34], risk 
analyses [SP 800-30], after-action reports from exercises, incident reports, and recovery plans.   

Cyber resiliency analysis complements both system life cycle and RMF tasks. The life cycle and 
RMF tasks produce information that can be used in cyber resiliency analysis, and cyber resiliency 
analysis enables cyber risks to be considered more fully in life cycle and RMF tasks.

3.2.1   Understand the Context 

The problem of providing sufficient cyber resiliency properties and behaviors is inherently 
situated in a programmatic, operational, architectural, and threat context. This step is intended 
to ensure that the context is sufficiently understood and that cyber resiliency constructs can be 
interpreted in that context, the relative priorities of cyber resiliency objectives can be assessed, 
and the applicability of cyber resiliency design principles, techniques, and approaches can be 
determined. The activities in this step can and should be integrated into activities under the 
Technical Management Processes in [SP 800-160 v1] and the Prepare and Categorize steps of 
the RMF [SP 800-37]. 

3.2.1.1   Identify the Programmatic Context 

The programmatic context identifies how the system of interest is being acquired, developed, 
modified, or repurposed, including the life cycle stage, life cycle model, or system development 
approach (e.g., spiral, waterfall, agile, DevOps). Identification of the life cycle stage, life cycle 
model, and system development approach enables maturity as a consideration in defining cyber 
resiliency solutions. The programmatic context also identifies the stakeholders for the system of 
interest, roles and responsibilities related to the system of interest, and entities (organizations, 
organizational units, or individuals) in those roles.  

In particular, the programmatic context identifies the entities responsible for directing, 
executing, and determining the acceptability of the results of engineering efforts related to the 
system (e.g., program office, systems engineer, systems integrator, authorizing official, and 
mission or business function owner). Each of these key stakeholders has a risk management 
strategy focused on different potential risks (e.g., cost, schedule, and technical or performance 
risks for a program office or systems engineer; security risks for an authorizing official; mission 
or business risks for a mission or business function owner). When these entities are part of the 
same organization, the risk management strategies for their respective areas of responsibility 
instantiate or are aligned with the organization’s cyber risk management strategy.45  

Technical or performance risks can include risks that quality properties (e.g., security, safety, 
system resilience, cyber resiliency) are insufficiently provided, as evidenced by the absence or

CHAPTER THREE

poor execution of behaviors that should demonstrate those properties. The programmatic risk 
management strategy can reflect the relative priorities that other stakeholders—in particular, 
the mission or business process owner and the authorizing official—assign to different quality 
properties. The programmatic risk management strategy can also include constraints on less 
mature technologies, less commonly used products, or less commonly applied operational 
practices as part of managing technical or performance risks.46 

In addition, other stakeholders may have their own risk management strategies or may be 
represented by an official within these entities (e.g., a system security officer to represent the 
security concerns of program managers whose proprietary information is handled by the system 
of interest) with a corresponding risk management strategy. An appreciation of the different risk 
management strategies (i.e., how the various stakeholders frame risk, including what threats 
and potential harms or adverse consequences are of concern to them, what their risk tolerances 
are, and what risk trade-offs they are willing to make) will enable the threat model to be defined 
and cyber resiliency constructs to be interpreted and prioritized in subsequent steps.  

The programmatic context is not static. Technical, schedule, or security risks can include risks 
related to other programs or initiatives within the organization, its partners, or its suppliers. The 
design of the system of interest could assume successful completion of milestones by other 
programs or initiatives prior to a step in its development, contributing to technical or schedule 
risks. Schedule slips or failures to meet specific requirements by other programs or initiatives 
could also increase the attack surface of the system of interest or make it more fragile. Thus, 
understanding which other programs or initiatives could affect the system of interest is part of 
identifying the programmatic context.47 

Identification of the programmatic context highlights the aspects of the programmatic risk 
management strategy that constrain possible solutions. One aspect is the relative priority of 
such quality attributes as safety, security, reliability, maintainability, system resilience, and 
cyber resiliency. Another is the relative preference for operational changes versus technical 
changes. Depending on the life cycle stage and the programmatic risk management strategy, 
changes to operational processes and procedures may be preferred to technical changes to the 
system. 

3.2.1.2   Identify the Architectural Context 

The architectural context identifies the type of system; its architecture or architectural patterns, 
if already defined; and its interfaces with or dependencies on other systems with consideration 
of whether it is (or is intended to be) part of a larger system-of-systems or a participant in a 
larger ecosystem. Key technologies, technical standards, or products included (or expected to be 
included) in the system are identified. Depending on the life cycle stage, identification of the 
architectural context can also include system locations, sub-systems or components, or layers in 
the architecture where cyber resiliency solutions could be applied. If this information is not yet 
available, it will be developed in a subsequent step.48

CHAPTER THREE 
 
 PAGE 35 

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v2r1

The identification of the type of system begins with the identification of its general type (e.g., 
CPS,49 application, enterprise service, common infrastructure as part of EIT or LSPE, EIT as a 
whole, or LSPE as a whole). The type of system determines which cyber resiliency techniques 
and approaches are most relevant.50 Each type of system has an associated set of architectural 
patterns. For example, a CPS device typically includes a sensor, a controller (which is present in 
cyberspace), an actuator, and a physical layer. EIT typically includes enterprise services (e.g., 
identity and access management, mirroring and backup, email), common infrastructures (e.g., 
an internal communications network, a storage area network, a virtualization, or a cloud 
infrastructure), a demilitarized zone (DMZ) for interfacing with the Internet, and a collection of 
enterprise applications.  

Identification of other systems with which the system of interest interfaces or on which it 
depends includes consideration of federation, networking, and scope. Federation typically 
restricts the set of solutions that can be applied and the metrics that can be defined and used 
since different system owners may be unwilling or unable to use the same technologies or share 
certain types or forms of information. Some systems are designed to operate without a network 
connection, at least transiently and often normally. The cyber resiliency solutions and means of 
assessing system cyber resiliency or solution effectiveness will be limited by whether the system 
is operating in detached mode. Depending on the programmatic context, the scope of “other 
systems” can include those constituting the system’s development, test, or maintenance 
environment. 

3.2.1.3   Identify the Operational Context 

The operational context identifies how the system of interest is used or will be used (i.e., its 
usage context, which is closely related to the architectural context), how it will be administered 
and maintained (i.e., its support context, which is closely related to the programmatic and 
architectural contexts), how it interacts with or depends on other systems (i.e., its dependency 
context), and how usage and dependencies change depending on the time or circumstances 
(i.e., its temporal context).  

The usage context identifies the primary mission or business functions that the system supports, 
any secondary or supporting missions or business functions, and the criticality and reliability 
with which the missions or business functions are to be achieved. Thus, the usage context can: 

• 
Describe the system in terms of its intended uses, which include not only its primary mission 
or business function but also secondary or likely additional uses. The description includes 
the identification of external interfaces—to networks, other supporting infrastructures and 
services, and end users—in a functional sense, keeping in mind that these interfaces can 
vary. 

• 
Describe the system’s criticality to its missions, stakeholders, end users, or the general 
public. Criticality is “an attribute assigned to an asset that reflects its relative importance or 
necessity in achieving or contributing to the achievement of stated goals” [SP 800-160 v1] 
and relates strongly to the potential impacts of system malfunction, degraded or denied 

 

49 Multiple levels of aggregation have been defined for CPS: a device, a system, or a system-of-systems [SP 1500-201]. 
For example, a smart meter is an example of a CPS device; a vehicle is an example of a CPS; and the Smart Grid is an 
example of a system-of-systems CPS.

performance, or not performing to the missions it supports, human life or safety, national 
security, or economic security (e.g., as in the context of critical infrastructure [NIST CSF]).  

• 
Identify whether the system is or contains a high-value asset (HVA) (e.g., as defined in [OMB 
M-19-03], repositories of large volumes of PII or financial assets) or plays a central role 
(even if non-critical) in a critical infrastructure sector (e.g., financial services, Defense 
Industrial Base [DIB]) since these characteristics could attract specific types of adversaries. 

• 
If possible, identify measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) 
for organizational missions or business functions. Cyber resiliency effectiveness metrics, 
which can be defined and used later in the analysis process,51 can sometimes repurpose 
mission MOEs, MOPs, or data collected to evaluate MOEs and MOPs and can often be 
related to MOEs and MOPs, particularly for cyber resiliency metrics related to Withstand or 
Recover. 

The usage context also provides a general characterization of the system user population, 
including its size, scope, and assumed user awareness of and ability to respond to cyber threats. 
The usage context also indicates whether cyber defenders are actively involved in monitoring 
the system and responding to indications and warnings (I&W) of adverse conditions or 
behaviors. 

The support context similarly provides a general characterization of the administrative and 
maintenance population, describes how system maintenance or updates are performed, and 
describes operational restrictions on maintenance activities or updates. For example, updates to 
embedded control units (ECUs) in a vehicle should be disallowed when driving. These aspects of 
the operational context determine the extent to which procedural solutions can be applied to 
the system of interest. 

The dependency context identifies adjacent systems (i.e., systems with which the system of 
interest is connected, for example, through procedure calls or information sharing); describes 
the types of information received from, supplied to, or exchanged with those systems; and 
identifies the criticality of the information connection to the system of interest and to the 
mission or business functions it supports. The dependency context also identifies infrastructures 
on which the system of interest depends (e.g., networks, power suppliers, and environmental 
control systems). These aspects of the operational context are used to bound the scope of the 
analysis (e.g., whether and for which adjacent or infrastructure systems changes are in scope, 
whether characteristics and behavior of these systems can be investigated or must be assumed). 
If the system of interest is part of a system-of-systems or is a participant in a larger ecosystem, 
the dependency context identifies the implications of aggregation or federation for governance, 
system administration, and information sharing with other organizations or systems. 

The temporal context identifies whether and how the usage and dependency contexts can 
change, depending on whether the system is operating under normal, stressed, or maintenance 
conditions; whether the system is being used for one of its secondary purposes; and how the 
system’s usage and dependencies change over time during the course of executing mission or 
business functions.

Information about the support and dependency contexts can be used at this point in the 
analysis to characterize and subsequently identify the system’s attack surfaces.52 The 
operational context can be communicated by defining a motivating operational scenario or a 
small set of operational scenarios. 

3.2.1.4   Identify the Threat Context 

The threat context identifies threat sources, threat events, and threat scenarios of concern for 
the system of interest. In particular, the threat context helps to identify the characteristics and 
behaviors of adversaries whose attacks would necessarily undermine the system’s ability to 
execute or support its missions, as well as the characteristics of relevant non-adversarial threats. 
Adversaries can include insiders as well as individuals or groups located outside of the system’s 
physical and logical security perimeter. Adversary goals are identified and translated into cyber 
and mission effects. Adversary behaviors (i.e., threat events, attack scenarios, or TTPs) are also 
identified.  

The threat context can: 

• 
Identify the types of threats considered in programmatic or organizational risk framing. In 
addition to adversarial threats, these can include non-adversarial threats of human error, 
faults and failures, and natural disasters. A cyber resiliency analysis can identify scenarios in 
which adversaries can take advantage of the consequences of non-adversarial threat events. 

• 
Identify the adversary’s characteristics, to construct an adversary profile. Characteristics can 
include the adversary’s ultimate goals and intended cyber effects, the specific time frame 
over which the adversary operates, the adversary’s persistence (or, alternately, how easily 
the adversary can be deterred, discouraged, or redirected to a different target), the 
adversary’s concern for stealth, and the adversary’s targeting, which relates to the scope or 
scale of the effects that the adversary intends to achieve. Note that multiple adversaries can 
be profiled.   

• 
Identify the types of threat events or adversarial behaviors of concern. Behaviors are 
described in terms of adversary TTPs and can be categorized using the categories of the 
Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK™) framework [Strom17] 
or .govCAR [DHSCDM]. 

• 
Identify the potential attack scenarios of concern and describe each scenario with a phrase 
or a sentence. A set of attack scenarios (e.g., as identified in [Bodeau18a] [Bodeau16]) can 
serve as a starting point. The attack scenarios of concern in the cyber resiliency use case 
should be clearly related to the system’s mission. Note that a cyber resiliency analysis can 
focus on a single attack scenario or consider a set of scenarios.  

A threat model can also include potential threat scenarios related to non-adversarial threat 
sources. For these threat sources, the scope or scale of effects, duration or time frame, and 
types of assets affected are identified. If possible, provide a reference to a publicly available 
description of a similar scenario to serve as an anchoring example. 

Depending on its scope and purpose, a cyber resiliency analysis can focus on a single threat 
scenario. For example, a cyber resiliency analysis can be motivated by a publicized incident with

the purpose of the analysis being to determine the extent to which a particular system, mission 
or business function, or organization could be affected by a similar incident. 

3.2.1.5   Interpret and Prioritize Cyber Resiliency Constructs 

To ensure that cyber resiliency concepts and constructs are meaningful in the identified 
contexts, one or more of the following sub-tasks can be performed: 

• 
Restate and prioritize cyber resiliency objectives53 and sub-objectives.54 Identify, restate, 
and prioritize capabilities or activities that are needed to achieve relevant sub-objectives 
based on the identified threat context. These constructs are restated in terms that are 
meaningful in the architectural and operational contexts and prioritized based on 
programmatic considerations and stakeholder concerns. Note that responsibility for some 
capabilities or activities may be allocated to system elements outside of the scope of the 
engineering or risk management decisions that the cyber resiliency analysis is intended to 
support.  

• 
Determine the potential applicability of cyber resiliency design principles. This involves 
considering organizational and programmatic risk management strategies to determine 
which strategic design principles may apply. It also involves considering the architecture, 
operational context, and threat environment to identify the relevance of structural design 
principles to this situation. Relevant structural design principles are restated in situation-
specific terms (e.g., in terms of the technologies that are part of the system). 

• 
Determine the potential applicability of cyber resiliency techniques and (depending on the 
level of detail with which the architectural context is defined) implementation approaches. 
This involves considering the architecture, operational context, and threat context. The 
relevance of the techniques and of the approaches to this situation is described and 
assessed. Relevant techniques and approaches can be restated and described in terms of 
architectural elements (e.g., allocating an implementation approach to a specific system 
element or identifying an architectural layer at which a technique can be applied). However, 
detailed descriptions are generally deferred to a later stage in a cyber resiliency analysis.55  

The determination that some cyber resiliency constructs are not applicable, based on the 
considerations discussed in Section 3.1, narrows the focus of subsequent steps in the cyber 
resiliency analysis, which saves work and increases the usefulness of the results.  

3.2.2   Develop the Cyber Resiliency Baseline 

In order to determine whether cyber resiliency improvement is needed, the baseline for the 
system (as it is understood at the stage in the life cycle when the cyber resiliency analysis is 
performed) must be established.  

3.2.2.1   Establish the Initial Cyber Resiliency Baseline 

As discussed in Section 3.1.5.1, a system reflects architectural and design decisions and 
investments in specific technologies and products motivated by other specialty engineering

disciplines. Capabilities are identified from such functional areas as COOP and contingency 
planning; security, cybersecurity, and cyber defense; performance management; reliability, 
maintainability, and availability (RMA); safety; and survivability. Identification of capabilities can 
involve decomposition of the system of interest into constituent sub-systems, functional areas, 
and/or architectural locations.56 

Capabilities can be characterized in terms of the cyber resiliency techniques and approaches 
they can implement and/or the cyber resiliency design principles they can be used to apply. 
Capabilities can also be characterized in terms of how easily their configuration or operational 
use can be adapted to address specific cyber resiliency concerns, how dynamically they can be 
reconfigured or repurposed, and how compatible they are with other cyber resiliency 
techniques and approaches (e.g., deception, unpredictability). 

3.2.2.2   Identify Gaps and Issues 

Depending on the life cycle stage, issues may already be tracked, or it may be possible to 
identify gaps in required capabilities and issues with the system’s design, implementation, or 
use. Such information can be found in after-action reports from exercises, penetration test 
reports, incident reports, and reporting related to ongoing assessments and ongoing risk 
response actions (RMF tasks M-2 and M-3) [SP 800-37]. Security gaps may also have been 
identified from a coverage analysis with respect to a taxonomy of attack events or TTPs 
[DHSCDM]. 

Because senior leadership is often aware of issues and gaps, recommended cyber resiliency 
solutions will need to be characterized in terms of how and how well the solutions address the 
issues and gaps, as well as in terms of other benefits that the recommended solutions provide 
(e.g., improved stability, improved performance). 

3.2.2.3   Define Evaluation Criteria and Make Initial Assessment 

One or more evaluation criteria are established and used to make an initial assessment. Cyber 
resiliency can be evaluated in multiple ways, including: 

• 
How well the system achieves (or, assuming it meets its requirements, will achieve) cyber 
resiliency objectives and sub-objectives (considering the priority weighting established 
earlier).57 An initial assessment can be expressed as high-level qualitative assessments (e.g., 
on a scale from Very Low to Very High) for the cyber resiliency objectives and subsequently 
refined based on analysis of the system. An initial assessment can also take the form of a 
cyber resiliency coverage map that indicates whether and how well the cyber resiliency 
constructs that were determined to be relevant have been applied.58 Alternately (if the 
information is available) or subsequently (based on the analysis described in Section 3.2.3.1 
and Section 3.2.3.3),59 this assessment can be expressed as a cyber resiliency score.

• 
How well the system’s capabilities cover (i.e., have at least one effect on) adversary 
activities as identified by the threat context.60 This can be expressed as a threat heat map 
[DHSCDM] or a simple threat coverage score. For an initial assessment, coverage can be in 
terms of attack stages.61 Alternately or subsequently, a more nuanced threat coverage score 
based on the organization’s risk management strategy can be computed using the relative 
priorities of the general types of effects (e.g., increase adversary cost, decrease adversary 
benefits, increase adversary risk) and of the specific effects (e.g., redirect, preclude, impede, 
detect, limit, expose) if the risk management strategy establishes such priorities. 

• 
The level of cyber risk in terms of risk to missions, business functions, or other forms of risk 
(e.g., security, safety, reputation). An assessment of this form is possible if the organization 
has established a risk model, or at least a consequence model, for such forms of risk. An 
initial assessment will typically rely on an existing security risk assessment [SP 800-30]. 

• 
The level of operational resilience (i.e., mission or business function resilience) in terms of 
functional performance measures under stress. An assessment of this form is possible if the 
organization has established such performance measures. An initial assessment will typically 
rely on an existing performance assessment, which describes operational resilience in the 
face of prior incidents and will be subject to uncertainty since prior incidents may be poor 
predictors of future ones. 

Additional evaluation criteria can consider how well the system meets its security requirements 
or achieves its security objectives and how well the system satisfies its mission or business 
function requirements. While such evaluations are independent of cyber resiliency analysis, they 
can form part of the baseline against which potential solutions can be evaluated. 

Stakeholder concerns and priorities are used to determine which (or which combination) of 
these will be used to evaluate alternative solutions. Approaches to assessment (e.g., scoring 
systems, qualitative assessment scales, metrics and measures of effectiveness) and candidate 
metrics can be identified for use in subsequent steps. In addition, evaluation criteria can involve 
assessments of potential costs in terms of financial investment over subsequent life cycle stages 
(e.g., acquiring, integrating, operating, and maintaining a cyber resiliency solution), opportunity 
costs (e.g., constraints on future engineering decisions or system uses), and increased 
programmatic risk (e.g., potential cost risk, schedule impacts, performance impacts). 

3.2.3   Analyze the System 

In this step, the system is analyzed in its operational context from two perspectives. First, a 
mission or business function perspective is applied to identify critical resources (i.e., those 
resources for which damage or destruction would severely impact operations) and sources of 
system fragility. Second, an adversarial perspective is applied to identify high-value primary and 
secondary targets of APT actors [OMB M-19-03] and develop representative attack scenarios. 
Based on this analysis and the results of the previous baseline assessment, opportunities for 
improvement are identified.

3.2.3.1   Identify Critical Resources, Sources of Fragility, and Attack Surfaces 

A critical resource can be a resource for which damage (e.g., corruption or reduced availability), 
denial of service, or destruction results in the inability to complete a critical task. In addition, if a 
resource is used in multiple tasks, it can be highly critical overall even if it is not critical to any of 
those functions individually if its damage, denial, or destruction results in a delay for a time-
critical mission or business function. Critical resources can be identified using a variety of 
methods specific to contingency planning, resilience engineering, and mission assurance. These 
include Criticality Analysis [IR 8179], Mission Impact Analysis (MIA), Business Impact Analysis 
(BIA) [SP 800-34], Crown Jewels Analysis (CJA), and cyber mission impact analysis (CMIA).  

For cyber resiliency analysis, the identification of critical resources is based on an understanding 
of functional flows or of mission or business function threads. A resource can be highly critical at 
one point in a functional flow or a mission thread and of very low criticality at other points. A 
functional flow analysis or a mission thread analysis can reveal such time dependencies. 

Systems can also be analyzed to identify sources of fragility or brittleness. While identification of 
single points of failure is a result of the analysis methods mentioned above, network analysis or 
graph analysis (i.e., analysis of which system elements are connected, how and how tightly the 
system elements are connected, and whether some sets of system elements are more central) 
can determine whether the system is fragile (i.e., whether it will break if a stress beyond a well-
defined set is applied). Similarly, graphical analysis of the distribution of different types of 
components can help determine how easily a given stress (e.g., exploitation of a zero-day 
vulnerability) could propagate.  

Finally, the attack surfaces to which cyber resiliency solutions can be applied can be identified. 
Information about the programmatic, architectural, and operational context determines which 
attack surfaces are within the scope of potential cyber resiliency solutions. For example, if the 
programmatic context determines support systems to be in scope, those systems are an attack 
surface in addition to the interfaces and procedures by which updates are made to the system 
of interest; if the system of interest is an enterprise service (architectural context), its interfaces 
to other services on which it depends as well as to applications which use it are also attack 
surfaces; if the system has users (operational context), the user community is an attack 
surface.62 

3.2.3.2   Represent the Adversary Perspective 

Cyber resiliency analysis assumes an architectural, operational, and threat context for the 
system being analyzed.63 These contextual assumptions provide the starting point for a detailed 
analysis of how an adversary could affect the system and thereby cause harm to the mission or 
business functions it supports, the organization, individuals for whom the system handles PII or 
whose safety depends on the system, or the operational environment. The attack scenarios of 
concern that were identified as part of the threat context serve as a starting point.64 Depending 
on the scope of the analysis,65 these attack scenarios can be complemented by scenarios driven 

 

62 See Section D.5.1.3. 

63 See Section 3.2.1. 

64 See Section 3.2.1.4. 

65 As noted in Section 3.2.1.4, a cyber resiliency analysis can be focused on a single attack scenario.

by adversary goals, scenarios targeting critical assets or high-value assets,66 or scenarios that 
take advantage of sources of fragility. 

The adversary perspective (i.e., what harm can be done, how easily, and at what cost to the 
attacker) can be represented in different ways, depending on the stage of the system life cycle 
and the corresponding level and amount of information about the system architecture, design, 
implementation, and operations. At a minimum, an attack scenario can identify stages in the 
attack (e.g., administer, engage, persist, cause effect, and maintain ongoing presence), the 
adversary objectives or categories of TTPs at each stage (e.g., reconnaissance, exploitation, 
lateral movement, denial), and the system elements compromised in each stage. Depending on 
the system life cycle stage, it may be possible to identify individual TTPs (e.g., pass the hash) or 
examples of specific malware.67   

Attack scenarios can be represented as part of a model-based engineering effort; using attack 
tree or attack graph analysis; in terms of fault tree analysis or failure modes, effects, and 
criticality analysis (FMECA); or based on the identification of loss scenarios from System-
Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). Common elements across the attack scenarios (e.g., recurring 
adversary TTPs) can be starting points for identifying potential alternative solutions.  

Depending on the scope of the cyber resiliency analysis, attack scenarios can be developed that 
target supporting systems. Such attack scenarios may be the result of a supply chain risk analysis 
or a cyber resiliency or cybersecurity analysis of systems or organizations responsible for 
development, integration, testing, or maintenance. 

3.2.3.3   Identify and Prioritize Opportunities for Improvement 

The identification of potential areas of improvement typically relies on the interpretation and 
prioritization of cyber resiliency constructs performed earlier.68 Potential cyber resiliency 
techniques or implementation approaches can be identified in system-specific terms, mapped to 
system elements or architectural layers, and stated as desired improvements to system 
elements or to the system as a whole. Desired improvements are prioritized based on how and 
how well they are expected to reduce risks as identified by stakeholders.69  

In more detail, this task in the analysis process can include the following sub-tasks: 

• 
Identify potentially applicable techniques or approaches. If the set of potentially applicable 
techniques and approaches has already been identified,70 it can be narrowed by identifying 
the set of techniques and approaches related to prioritized objectives using Appendix D, 
Table D-13 or to potentially applicable structural design principles using Table D-15. (If only 
the applicable strategic design principles were identified, Table D-14 can be used to identify 
relevant objectives and Table D-10 can be used to identify relevant structural design 
principles.) Otherwise, the set of techniques and approaches related to prioritized

67 However, specific malware should be treated as a motivating example only. Cyber resiliency engineering assumes 
that unforeseen malware can be used and seeks to mitigate types of adversary actions.

objectives or structural design principles can be refined by taking the architectural and 
programmatic context into consideration. The potentially applicable techniques or 
approaches are described in system-specific terms. 

• 
Identify locations where cyber resiliency solutions could be applied.71 The set of locations 
(i.e., sub-systems or components, layers in the architecture, or interfaces between sub-
systems or between layers) where cyber resiliency solutions could be applied is determined 
by the system architecture as constrained by context.72 For example, the programmatic 
context may prioritize cyber resiliency solutions that change how existing technologies are 
used over changes to the system architecture (e.g., replacing specific system elements); the 
architectural context may restrict locations to specific interfaces (e.g., if the system of 
interest is an enterprise service, solutions may be applied to its interfaces with sub-systems 
or applications that use it or with supporting services, particularly security services); or the 
operational context may constrain the extent to which new user procedures can be made 
part of the system (e.g., depending on the size of, cyber expertise of, or organizational 
control over the user population).  

• 
Identify desired improvements to system elements or to the system of interest as a whole. 
Statements of desired improvements described in terms specific to the architectural and 
operational context can be more meaningful to stakeholders than general statements about 
improved use of a cyber resiliency technique or a more effective application of a cyber 
resiliency design principle. Potential improvements can be described in terms of improved 
protection for critical resources, reduced fragility, or the ability to address threats more 
effectively. 

• 
Prioritize desired improvements using the identified evaluation criteria (e.g., improve the 
ability of a given system element to continue functioning by enabling that element to be 
dynamically isolated, decrease adversary benefits by reducing the concentration of highly 
sensitive information in a single asset, or reduce mission risks by providing extra resources 
for high-criticality tasks). 

3.2.4   Define and Analyze Specific Alternatives 

In this step, specific ways to make desired improvements (i.e., architectural changes, ways to 
implement cyber resiliency techniques in the context of the existing architecture, ways to use 
existing system capabilities more effectively to improve resilience) are identified and analyzed in 
terms of potential effectiveness. These specific alternatives form a solution set that will be used 
in the final step to construct potential courses of action.  

3.2.4.1   Define Potential Technical and Procedural Solutions 

Potential applications of cyber resiliency techniques and implementation approaches to the 
system of interest in its environment of operations in order to provide one or more desired 
improvements are identified.73 These applications (i.e., potential solutions to the problem of 
improving mission or operational resilience by improving cyber resiliency) can be purely 
technical, purely procedural, or combinations of the two.

system depends on the system type.76 The degree to which relatively immature technologies can 
be considered depends on the programmatic risk management strategy.77 

The level of detail with which a potential solution is described depends on how specifically the 
context was described in the first step.78 In particular, if the architectural and operational 
contexts were described in general terms, potential solutions will necessarily be described at a 
high level. Alternatively, if the cyber resiliency analysis is being performed for an existing 
system, a potential solution can be described in terms of specific technologies or products to be 
integrated into the system, where in the system those technologies will be used, how they will 
interface with other system elements, configuration settings or ranges of settings for products, 
and processes or procedures to make effective use of existing or newly acquired technologies.  

The description of a potential solution can include identification of the gaps it is expected to 
address,79 the threats (e.g., attack scenarios, adversary objectives or categories of TTPs, or 
adversary actions) it is intended to address,80 or the reduced exposure of critical resources, 
sources of fragility, or attack surfaces to threats.81 These different elements of a potential 
solution’s description can be used to evaluate the solution.82 

3.2.4.2   Define Potential Solutions for Supporting Systems and Processes 

If programmatic and operational contexts support improvements to supporting systems and 
processes, the potential applications of cyber resiliency techniques and approaches to these 
systems and processes are also identified. Such applications can include modifications to 
contracting to help ensure that controlled unclassified information (CUI) or other sensitive 
information is protected [SP 800-171], improvements to supply chain risk management (SCRM) 
as determined by SCRM analysis [SP 800-161], and restrictions on or re-architecting of system 
development, testing, or maintenance environments to improve the cyber resiliency of those 
environments.  

3.2.4.3   Analyze Potential Solutions with Respect to Criteria 

Potential solutions can be analyzed with respect to one or more criteria.83 Evaluation can 
employ qualitative or semi-quantitative assessments (using subject matter expert [SME] 
judgments) or quantitative metrics (evaluated in a model-based environment, laboratory, cyber 
range, or test environment; metrics to support analysis of alternatives are typically not

evaluated in an operational environment). For example, potential solutions can be analyzed to 
determine: 

• 
How much the solution could improve the ability of the system to achieve its (priority-
weighted) cyber resiliency objectives or sub-objectives. This can be expressed as a change in 
a cyber resiliency score or as a coverage map for the relevant cyber resiliency constructs. 
Alternately or in support of scoring, performance metrics for activities or capabilities related 
to cyber resiliency sub-objectives can be evaluated. 

• 
How well the system, with the solution applied, addresses adversary activities or attack 
scenarios as identified by the threat context. As noted in Section 3.2.2.3, this can take the 
form of a threat heat map or a threat coverage score using a taxonomy of adversary 
activities (e.g., [MITRE18]). It can also take the form of an adversary return on investment 
(ROI) score or a more nuanced threat coverage score.84 Alternately or in support of scoring, 
performance metrics for specific types of effects on adversary actions can be defined and 
evaluated before and after the solution is applied (e.g., length of time it takes an adversary 
to move laterally across a system or an enclave).  

• 
How much the solution could improve the system’s coverage of adversary TTPs using 
capabilities defined in [NIST CSF]. This can be expressed as a change in a score or using a 
threat heat map [DHSCDM]. 

• 
How much the solution could decrease the level of cyber risk or a specific component of risk 
(e.g., level of consequence). As discussed in Appendix F,85 effects on adversary activities 
have associated effects on risk. 

• 
How much the solution could improve the level of operational resilience in terms of 
functional performance measures under stress. As discussed in Section D.5.1, some strategic 
design principles for cyber resiliency are closely related to design principles for Resilience 
Engineering. Thus, a solution that applies one or more of those design principles can be 
expected to improve resilience against non-adversarial as well as adversarial threats. 

• 
Whether and how much the solution could improve the system’s ability to meet its security 
requirements. Evaluation with respect to this criterion can involve qualitative assessments 
by subject matter experts (SME), an explanatory description, a list of previously unmet 
requirements that the solution can help meet, or specific security performance metrics that 
can be evaluated before and after the solution is applied.  

• 
Whether and how much the solution could improve the system’s ability to meet its mission 
or business function performance requirements. Similar to a security requirements criterion, 
evaluation with respect to this criterion can involve an explanatory description, qualitative 
assessments by SMEs, a list of previously unmet requirements that the solution can help 
meet, or specific functional performance metrics that can be evaluated before and after the 
solution is applied. 

In addition, the potential costs of a solution can be identified or assessed. The product of this 
step is a list of alternative solutions, with each alternative characterized (e.g., using a coverage 
map or a description) or assessed with respect to the identified criteria.

3.2.5   Develop Recommendations 

This step results in a plan of action to address recommended implementation approaches. 
Unless the scope of the cyber resiliency analysis is narrow, the number and variety of potential 
solutions may be large. Potential solutions that could be implemented at the same time can be 
constructed and analyzed to ensure compatibility, identify possible synergies, and determine 
whether specific solutions should be applied sequentially rather than simultaneously. In 
addition, programmatic and operational risks associated with alternative solutions can be 
identified. 

3.2.5.1   Identify and Analyze Alternatives 

One or more alternatives (i.e., sets of potential solutions that could be implemented at the same 
time or sequentially such as in successive spirals) can be identified using either total cost or a 
requirement for a consistent level of maturity86 (e.g., requiring all technical solutions in the set 
to be available as commercial products by a specific milestone) to bound each set. Where 
possible, a set of potential solutions should be defined to take advantage of synergies (as 
discussed in Section 3.1.4 and identified in Appendix D, Table D-3). At a minimum, each set 
should be analyzed to ensure that there are no internal conflicts. If the solutions in a set are to 
be implemented sequentially, functional dependencies among those solutions should be 
identified. In addition, functional dependencies on other system elements (particularly those 
involving investments due to other disciplines)87 should be identified since changes in system 
elements can be made for a variety of reasons. Finally, functional dependencies on other 
organizational efforts (e.g., programs, initiatives) should be identified to ensure that changes to 
the attack surfaces of the system of interest, the organization’s infrastructure and supporting 
services, and other systems or assets are understood and the associated risks managed.88 

3.2.5.2   Assess Alternatives 

Each alternative can be assessed or characterized in terms of the evaluation criteria.89 To 
support assessments, the adversarial analysis90 can be revisited for each alternative. Due to 
synergies or other interactions between cyber resiliency techniques, changes in scores, heat 
maps, or coverage maps must be determined by analysis rather than by simply combining 
previously determined values. In addition, each alternative should be analyzed to determine 
whether it makes new attack scenarios (or non-adversarial threat scenarios) possible. If it does, 
those scenarios should be analyzed to determine whether changes should be made to the 
alternative. 

Each alternative can also be described in terms of the issues it resolves, the gaps it fills,91 or 
whether it provides improved protection for critical resources, reduced fragility, or the ability to 
address threats more effectively. Finally, each alternative can be assessed or described in terms 
of its effects on programmatic risk (e.g., total costs, changes to schedule risk, changes to

technical or performance risk) or other risks of concern to stakeholders. If an alternative 
diverges from the risk management strategies of one or more stakeholders, this divergence 
should be noted so that a compensating risk management approach can be made part of the 
recommendation if the alternative is in fact recommended. 

3.2.5.3   Recommend a Plan of Action 

A recommended plan of action resulting from a cyber resiliency analysis can take the form of a 
set of selected alternatives to be implemented in successive phases. For each phase, the costs, 
benefits, and risk management approaches can be identified, accompanied by the identification 
of circumstances that could indicate the need to revisit the recommendations. However, as 
noted in Section 3.1, a cyber resiliency analysis can be narrowly focused. If this is the case, the 
recommendations resulting from the analysis will take a form directed by the focus of the 
analysis.

APPENDIX A 

GLOSSARY 
COMMON TERMS AND DEFINITIONS 

ppendix A provides definitions for terminology used in NIST SP 800-160, Volume 2. 
Sources for terms used in this publication are cited as applicable. Where no citation is 
noted, the source of the definition is SP 800-160, Volume 2. 

adaptability 
The property of an architecture, design, and implementation 
that can accommodate changes to the threat model, mission or 
business functions, systems, and technologies without major 
programmatic impacts. 

advanced cyber threat 
See advanced persistent threat. 

Note 1: The phrase “advanced cyber threat” implies either that an 
adversary executes a cyber-attack or that an adversary subverts the 
supply chain in order to compromise cyber resources. 

advanced persistent 
threat 
[SP 800-39] 

An adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of expertise and 
significant resources that allow it to create opportunities to 
achieve its objectives by using multiple attack vectors including, 
for example, cyber, physical, and deception. These objectives 
typically include establishing and extending footholds within the 
IT infrastructure of the targeted organizations for purposes of 
exfiltrating information, undermining or impeding critical aspects 
of a mission, program, or organization, or positioning itself to 
carry out these objectives in the future. The advanced persistent 
threat pursues its objectives repeatedly over an extended 
period; adapts to defenders’ efforts to resist it; and is 
determined to maintain the level of interaction needed to 
execute its objectives. 

Note 1: While some sources define APT (or advanced cyber threat) as 
an adversary at Tier V or Tier VI in the threat model in [DSB13]—in 
particular, to be a state actor—the definition used here includes 
criminal actors. 

Note 2: For brevity, “the APT” refers to any adversary with the 
characteristics described above or to the set of all such adversaries; “an 
APT actor” refers to a representative member of that set.  

Note 3: The APT may establish its foothold by subverting the supply 
chain in order to compromise cyber resources. Thus, the APT may be 
able to achieve its objectives without executing a cyber-attack against 
the organization’s systems (e.g., by inserting a logic bomb or time). 

Note 4: The term “APT” does not include the insider threat. However, if 
an APT actor establishes and extends its foothold by masquerading as a 
legitimate system user and taking advantage of that user’s authorized 
access privileges, it may be indistinguishable from an insider threat.

adversity 
Adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises. 

Note 1: The definition of adversity is consistent with the use of the 
term in [SP 800-160 v1] as disruptions, hazards, and threats. 

Note 2: Adversity in the context of the definition of cyber resiliency 
specifically includes but is not limited to cyber-attacks. 

agility 
The property of a system or an infrastructure that can be 
reconfigured, in which resources can be reallocated, and in 
which components can be reused or repurposed so that cyber 
defenders can define, select, and tailor cyber courses of action 
for a broad range of disruptions or malicious cyber activities. 

approach 
See cyber resiliency implementation approach. 

asset 
[SP 800-160 v1] 

An item of value to stakeholders. An asset may be tangible (e.g., 
a physical item such as hardware, firmware, computing platform, 
network device, or other technology component) or intangible 
(e.g., humans, data, information, software, capability, function, 
service, trademark, copyright, patent, intellectual property, 
image, or reputation). The value of an asset is determined by 
stakeholders in consideration of loss concerns across the entire 
system life cycle. Such concerns include but are not limited to 
business or mission concerns. 

attack surface 
[SP 800-53, adapted] 

The set of points on the boundary of a system, a system 
element, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, 
cause an effect on, or extract data from.  

Note: An attack surface can be reduced by removing points on the 
boundary (reducing the extent of the attack surface, such as by 
reducing the amount of code running) or reducing the exposure of 
some points to an attacker (e.g., by placing inessential functions on a 
different system element than essential functions, by layering 
defenses, by reducing the period of exposure); changed by changing 
the set of points on the boundary (e.g., by moving some points), by 
changing the exposure of some points to an attacker (e.g., by adding 
logic to check data or commands), or by changing the properties of 
some points (e.g., by applying principles of least privilege and least 
functionality); or disrupted by making changes unpredictably or by 
reducing its extent or exposure for limited time periods (e.g., by 
temporarily isolating components). 

authorization 
[CNSSI 4009] 

Access privileges granted to a user, program, or process or the 
act of granting those privileges. 

blockchain 
[IR 8202] 
[IR 8301]  
 

A distributed digital ledger of cryptographically-signed 
transactions that are grouped into blocks. Each block is 
cryptographically linked to the previous one (making it tamper 
evident) after validation and undergoing a consensus decision. 
As new blocks are added, older blocks become more difficult to 
modify (creating tamper resistance). New blocks are replicated 
across copies of the ledger within the network, and any conflicts 
are resolved automatically using established rules.

boundary 
[CNSSI 4009] 

A physical or logical perimeter of a system. 

contested cyber 
environment 

An environment in which APT actors, competing entities, and 
entities with similar resource needs contend for control or use of 
cyber resources. 

control 
[ISACA]

typically takes the form of a terse statement or a phrase 
identifying a key concept, accompanied by one or more 
statements that describe how that concept applies to system 
design (where “system” is construed broadly to include 
operational processes and procedures, and may also include 
development and maintenance environments). 

enabling system 
[ISO 15288]

information technology 
[OMB A-130] 

Any services, equipment, or interconnected system(s) or 
subsystem(s) of equipment, that are used in the automatic 
acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, 
management, movement, control, display, switching, 
interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by 
the agency. For purposes of this definition, such services or 
equipment if used by the agency directly or is used by a 
contractor under a contract with the agency that requires its 
use; or to a significant extent, its use in the performance of a 
service or the furnishing of a product. Information technology 
includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging 
peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for 
security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be 
controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, 
software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including 
cloud computing and help-desk services or other professional 
services which support any point of the life cycle of the 
equipment or service), and related resources. Information 
technology does not include any equipment that is acquired by a 
contractor incidental to a contract which does not require its 
use. 

mission assurance 
[DOD16, adapted] 

A process to protect or ensure the continued function and 
resilience of capabilities and assets—including personnel, 
equipment, facilities, networks, information and information 
systems, infrastructure, and supply chains—critical to the

to perform essential functions and services, without time delay, 
regardless of threats or conditions, and with the understanding 
that adequate warning of a threat may not be available. 

Note: This definition differs from the source definition by omitting “of 
the Federal executive branch” after “the ability.” Because essential 
functions and services are performed using systems, mission resilience 
can often be identified with operational resilience; usage depends on 
the intended emphasis. 

mitigation

associated with one or more threat events, threat scenarios, or 
vulnerabilities. 

non-adversarial threat 
A threat associated with accident or human error, structural 
failure, or environmental causes.

and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building 
management systems, fire control systems, and physical access 
control mechanisms. 

other system 
[ISO 15288] 

A system that the system of interest interacts with in the 
operational environment. These systems may provide services to 
the system of interest (i.e., the system of interest is dependent 
on the other systems) or be the beneficiaries of services 
provided by the system of interest (i.e., other systems are 
dependent on the system of interest). 

protection 
[SP 800-160 v1] 

In the context of systems security engineering, a control 
objective that applies across all types of asset types and the 
corresponding consequences of loss. A system protection 
capability is a system control objective and a system design 
problem. The solution to the problem is optimized through a 
balanced proactive strategy and a reactive strategy that is not 
limited to prevention. The strategy also encompasses avoiding 
asset loss and consequences; detecting asset loss and 
consequences; minimizing (i.e., limiting, containing, restricting) 
asset loss and consequences; responding to asset loss and 
consequences; recovering from asset loss and consequences; 
and forecasting or predicting asset loss and consequences.

Access privileges are granted based on a combination of a user’s 
identity, mission need, and the level of security risk that exists 
between the system being accessed and a user. RAdAC will use 
security metrics, such as the strength of the authentication 
method, the level of assurance of the session connection 
between the system and a user, and the physical location of a 
user, to make its risk determination.

zero trust architecture 
[EO 14028] 

A security model, a set of system design principles, and a 
coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy 
based on an acknowledgement that threats exist both inside and 
outside traditional network boundaries. The zero trust security 
model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, component, 
node, or service and instead requires continuous verification of 
the operational picture via real-time information from multiple 
sources to determine access and other system responses.

BACKGROUND 
CYBER RESILIENCY IN CONTEXT 

his appendix provides background and contextual information on cyber resiliency. It 
describes how the definition of cyber resiliency relates to other forms of resilience; the 
distinguishing characteristics of cyber resiliency, including the assumptions that underpin 
this specialty engineering discipline; the relationship between cyber resiliency engineering and 
other specialty engineering disciplines; and the relationship between cyber resiliency and risk. 

C.1   DEFINING CYBER RESILIENCY 

Cyber resiliency92 is defined as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to 
adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that include cyber resources.” 
This definition can be applied to a variety of entities, including:  

• 
A system  

• 
A mechanism, component, or system element  

• 
A shared service, common infrastructure, or system-of-systems identified with a mission or 
business function  

• 
An organization93  

• 
A critical infrastructure sector or a region 

• 
A system-of-systems in a critical infrastructure sector or sub-sector  

• 
The Nation  

Cyber resiliency is emerging as a key element in any effective strategy for mission assurance, 
business assurance, or operational resilience. The definition of cyber resiliency is informed by 
the definitions of the terms resilience and resiliency across various communities of interest, as 
illustrated in the following examples (italics added to highlight common goals):   

 

92 “Resilience” and “resiliency” are alternative spellings with resilience being more common. The term cyber resiliency 
is used in the cyber resiliency engineering framework described in this publication to avoid creating the impression 
that cyber resiliency engineering is a sub-discipline of resilience engineering. See Section C.2 for a discussion of the 
relationship. The term cyber resilience is used by many organizations to refer to organizational resilience against cyber 
threats with a strong emphasis on effective implementation of good cybersecurity practices and COOP. For example, 
the DHS Cyber Resilience Review (CRR), which is based on the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) CERT Resilience 
Management Model (RMM), focuses on good practices against conventional adversaries. Discussions of cyber 
resilience focus on improved risk governance (e.g., making cyber risk part of enterprise risk), improved cybersecurity 
to include incident response procedures and ongoing monitoring, and threat information sharing. These aspects of 
governance and operations are all important to an organization’s cyber preparedness strategy [Bodeau16]. However, 
discussions of cyber resilience, in the sense of operational resilience against cyber threats, generally omit the aspects 
of architecture and engineering, which are the focus of the cyber resiliency engineering framework and the design 
principles discussed in this publication. 

93 See [SP 800-39] for a discussion of the system, mission/business function, and organization levels. See [NIST CSF] 
for a discussion of critical infrastructure levels. See [SP 800-37, SP 800-160 v1] for a discussion of system-of-systems.

• 
Resilience for the Nation: The ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and 
rapidly recover from emergencies [PPD8]. 

• 
Critical Infrastructure Resilience: The ability to reduce the magnitude or duration of 
disruptive events. The effectiveness of a resilient infrastructure or enterprise depends upon 
its ability to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, and/or rapidly recover from a potentially disruptive 
event [NIAC10]. 

• 
Resilience for National Security Systems: The ability to prepare for and adapt to changing 
conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions. Resilience includes the 
ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally occurring 
threats or incidents [CNSSI 1253] [SP 800-37]. 

• 
Community Resilience: The ability of a community to prepare for anticipated hazards, adapt 
to changing conditions, withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions [SP 1190]. 

• 
Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience: The ability to prepare for and adapt to 
changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions. Resilience includes 
the ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or naturally 
occurring threats or incidents [PPD21]. 

• 
Information System Resilience: The ability of a system to continue to operate under adverse 
conditions or stress, even if in a degraded or debilitated state, while maintaining essential 
operational capabilities and recover to an effective operational posture in a time frame 
consistent with mission needs [SP 800-53]. 

• 
Resilience in Cyberspace: The ability to adapt to changing conditions and prepare for, 
withstand, and rapidly recover from disruption [DHS10]. 

• 
Network Resilience: The ability of the network to provide and maintain an acceptable level 
of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation [Sterbenz06]. 

• 
Operational Resilience: The ability of systems to resist, absorb, and recover from or adapt to 
an adverse occurrence during operation that may cause harm, destruction, or loss of ability 
to perform mission-related functions [CNSS 4009]. 

• 
Resilience Engineering: The ability to build systems that can anticipate and circumvent 
accidents, survive disruptions through appropriate learning and adaptation, and recover 
from disruptions by restoring the pre-disruption state as closely as possible [Madni09]. 

Despite the different scope covered by each definition, there are some commonalities across 
the definitions. Each definition expresses a common theme of addressing those situations or 
conditions in which disruption, adversity, errors, faults, or failures occur. The definitions express 
consistent resiliency goals (shown in italics above) when encountering specific situations or 
conditions causing disruption, adversity, and faults. The definition of cyber resiliency adopted 
for use in this publication is consistent with the definitions cited above. 

C.2   DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF CYBER RESILIENCY 

Any discussion of cyber resiliency is distinguished by its focus and a priori threat assumptions. 
These are reflected in cyber resiliency constructs and engineering practices.

• 
Focus on the mission or business functions. 
Discussions of cyber resiliency focus on capabilities supporting organizational missions or 
business functions in order to maximize the ability of organizations to complete critical or 
essential missions or business functions despite an adversarial presence in their systems and 
infrastructure threatening mission-critical systems and system components. This is in 
contrast to focusing on the protection of information or on ensuring capabilities in a non-
adversarial environment. It is also in contrast to focusing on ensuring the resilience of 
system elements or of constituent systems in a system-of-systems. From the perspective of 
cyber resiliency, system elements or constituent systems that are less critical to mission or 
business effectiveness can be sacrificed to contain a cyber-attack and maximize mission 
assurance. 

• 
Assume a changing environment. 
Discussions related to cyber resiliency assume ongoing and episodic changes in the threat 
environment, the operational environment, and the technical environment. APT actors learn 
from experience. Their motives can change in response to economic and political factors, 
and their TTPs can become commodity tools for lower-level actors. The ways technology is 
used by individuals and organizations change due to events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, 
broader or more cost-effective availability of services such as cloud computing, and growing 
familiarity with and acceptance of newer technologies. The technical environment continues 
to evolve, such as with the rapid convergence of information technology and operational 
technology, the increasing maturity of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the 
transition to zero trust architectures. These changes can interact in many ways, increasing 
the complexity and reducing the transparency of systems, services, infrastructures, and 
ecosystems. From the perspective of cyber resiliency, changes can simultaneously present 
risks and opportunities for risk reduction. Risk management needs to consider differences in 
scale and time frame. 

• 
Focus on the effects of the advanced persistent threat. 
The definition of cyber resiliency encompasses all threats to systems containing cyber 
resources, whether such threats are cyber or non-cyber (e.g., kinetic) in nature. However, 
cyber resiliency analysis focuses on the effects that the APT can have on the system of 
interest and, thereby, on the missions or business functions, organization, or external 
stakeholders.  

In addition to immediately detectable effects (e.g., destruction of data, malfunction of a 
CPS, denial of service), the APT can produce effects that are detectable only after extended 
observation or forensic analysis of the system of interest (e.g., escalation of privileges, 
modification or fabrication of data or services, exfiltration of data). Consideration of cyber 
resiliency in systems security engineering seeks to mitigate such effects, independent of 
when or whether they may be detected.  

The resources associated with the APT, its stealthy nature, its persistent focus on the target 
of interest, and its ability to adapt in the face of defender actions make it a highly dangerous 
threat. Moreover, the APT can take advantage of or make its behavior appear to result from 
other forms of adversity, including human error, structural failure, or natural disaster. By 
focusing on APT activities and their potential effects, systems engineers produce systems 
that can anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to a broad and diverse suite of 
adverse conditions and stresses on systems containing cyber resources.

• 
Assume the adversary will compromise or breach the system or organization. 
A fundamental assumption in any discussion of cyber resiliency is that a sophisticated 
adversary cannot always be kept out of a system or be quickly detected and removed from 
that system, despite the quality of the system design, the functional effectiveness of the 
security components, and the trustworthiness of the selected components. This assumption 
acknowledges that modern systems are large and complex entities, and adversaries will 
always be able to find and exploit weaknesses and flaws in the systems (e.g., unpatched 
vulnerabilities, misconfigurations), environments of operation (e.g., social engineering, user 
vulnerability), and supply chains. As a result, a sophisticated adversary can penetrate an 
organizational system and achieve a presence within the organization’s infrastructure. 

• 
Assume the adversary will maintain a presence in the system or organization. 
Any discussion of cyber resiliency assumes that the adversary presence may be a persistent 
and long-term issue and recognizes that the stealthy nature of the APT makes it difficult for 
an organization to be certain that the threat has been eradicated. It also recognizes that the 
ability of the APT to adapt implies that previously successful mitigations may no longer be 
effective. Finally, it recognizes that the persistent nature of the APT means that even if an 
organization has succeeded in eradicating its presence, it may return. In some situations, the 
best outcome that an organization can achieve is containing the adversary’s malicious code 
or slowing its lateral movement across the system (or transitively across multiple systems) 
long enough that the organization is able to achieve its primary mission prior to losing its 
critical or essential mission capability. 

C.3   RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER SPECIALITY ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES 

Cyber resiliency is an aspect of trustworthiness, as are safety, system resilience, survivability, 
reliability, and security.94 Cyber resiliency concepts and engineering practices assume a basic 
foundation of security and reliability. Many cyber resiliency techniques use or rely on security, 
reliability, resilience, and fault-tolerance mechanisms, and many cyber resiliency techniques and 
design principles are relevant to zero trust architectures. The concepts and engineering 
practices described in this publication build on work in the specialty engineering disciplines of 
resilience engineering and dependable computing, including survivability engineering and fault 
tolerance.  

• 
Safety 
Safety is defined as “freedom from conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational 
illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment” [SP 
800-82]. Safety engineering focuses on identifying unacceptable system behaviors, 
outcomes, and interactions and helping to ensure that the system does not enter an 
unacceptable state (i.e., a state in which such behaviors, interactions, or outcomes are 
possible, thus creating or being an instance of a condition that can cause one of the harms 
identified above). System safety engineering is based on analytic processes rather than 
design principles or constructs. 

 

94 Trustworthiness requirements can include attributes of reliability, dependability, performance, resilience, safety, 
security, and survivability under a range of potential adversity in the form of disruptions, hazards, and threats [SP 
800-53].

 PAGE 79

[SP 800-160 v1] states that “the system aspects of secure operation may intersect, 
complement, or be in direct conflict or contradiction with those of safe operation of the 
system.” A similar statement may be made with respect to cyber-resilient operations. The 
set of unacceptable states defined by safety engineering may constitute a constraint on 
cyber resiliency solutions or may be used in trade-off analyses. As part of achieving a specific 
cyber resiliency objective, such as Continue or Reconstitute,95 a system may need to operate 
transiently in an unsafe (or insecure) state, depending on how stakeholders prioritize and 
trade off required system properties and behaviors. 

• 
Security 
The relationship between cyber resiliency and security depends on which definition of 
security is considered. [SP 800-37] defines security as: 

“A condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that 
enable an organization to perform its mission or critical functions despite risks posed by threats to 
its use of systems. Protective measures may involve a combination of deterrence, avoidance, 
prevention, detection, recovery, and correction that should form part of the organization’s risk 
management approach.” 

This definition of security overlaps with but does not subsume cyber resiliency since 
“protective measures,” as listed in the definition, do not fully cover risk management 
strategies related to cyber resiliency.96 

Cyber resiliency engineering may be viewed as a specialty discipline of systems security 
engineering. [SP 800-160 v1] defines security as the “freedom from those conditions that 
can cause loss of assets with unacceptable consequences.”97 In that context, security is 
concerned with the protection of assets and is primarily oriented to the concept of asset 
loss.98 It includes but is not limited to cybersecurity.99 Cyber resiliency engineering is 
oriented toward capabilities and harms to systems containing cyber resources. This 
orientation is consistent with the concept of asset loss since a capability is a form of 
intangible asset. As noted above, cyber resiliency engineering focuses on capabilities that 
support missions or business functions and on the effects of adversarial actions on systems. 
 

 

95 See Section 2.1.2. 

96 See Section C.4. 

97 This is a broader construction than what appears in [FIPS 199]. In accordance with [FISMA], FIPS 199 defines three 
security objectives for information and information systems: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. A loss of 
confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information; a loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or 
destruction of information; and a loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an 
information system. 

98 The term protection, in the context of systems security engineering, has a very broad scope and is primarily a 
control objective that applies across all asset types and corresponding consequences of loss. Therefore, the system 
protection capability is a system control objective and a system design problem. The solution to the problem is 
optimized through a balanced proactive and reactive strategy that is not limited to prevention. The strategy includes 
avoiding, detecting, minimizing (i.e., limiting, containing, restricting), responding to, recovering from, and forecasting 
or predicting asset loss and consequences [SP 800-160 v1]. 

99 Cybersecurity is defined as “the process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and responding to 
attacks” [NIST CSF] or as the “prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic 
communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, 
including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and 
nonrepudiation” [OMB A-130].

While [SP 800-160 v1] views security, asset loss, and protection broadly, much of the 
security literature and many security practitioners focus narrowly on the security objectives 
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems [FIPS 
199].100 Cyber resiliency engineering considers a broader range of cyber effects (i.e., effects 
in cyberspace) than the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or of 
system services. Cyber effects of concern to cyber resiliency engineering do include the 
effects of concern to security, including service degradation and denial or interruption of 
service; non-disruptive modification, fabrication, corruption, or destruction of information 
resources; and unauthorized disclosure of information. In addition, they include the 
usurpation or unauthorized use of resources, even when such use is non-disruptive to the 
system of interest; reduced confidence in system capabilities, which can alter system usage 
behavior; and alterations in behaviors that affect external systems, which can result in 
cascading failures beyond the system of interest.  

As noted above, cyber resiliency concepts and engineering practices assume a foundation of 
security. Some cyber resiliency techniques101 rely on the correct and effective application of 
security controls. Some cyber resiliency design principles102 adapt to, or are strongly aligned 
with, the security design principles described in [SP 800-160 v1]. 

• 
Zero Trust  
Zero trust is a security paradigm for enterprise computing with extensions to other 
computing environments (e.g., operational technology networks). A zero trust architecture 
(ZTA) can be characterized as a security model, a set of system design principles, and a 
coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy based on an acknowledgement 
that threats exist both inside and outside of traditional network boundaries [EO 14028]. 
Thus, cyber resiliency and zero trust share assumptions about cyber threats. However, 
where cyber resiliency is motivated by mission assurance in a contested cyber environment, 
zero trust is focused on preventing unauthorized access to data and services [SP 800-207]. 

Cyber resiliency includes a large number of constructs with the assumption that these will 
be interpreted, prioritized, and down selected for a given organization, mission or business 
function, or system of interest. Thus, two architectures can be equally cyber-resilient while 
providing radically different capabilities. In contrast, the expectation for a ZTA is that it will 
provide comprehensive security monitoring, granular risk-based access controls, and system 
security automation [EO 14028]. As noted in Section D.4 and Section D.5, multiple cyber 
resiliency techniques, approaches, and design principles can be integrated into the design 
and deployment of a ZTA, and some cyber resiliency techniques (e.g., Segmentation, 
Privilege Restriction) are essential to ZT. 

• 
Resilience Engineering and Survivability Engineering 
The specialty disciplines of resilience engineering and survivability engineering address 
system resilience whether or not the system of interest contains cyber resources. Cyber 
resiliency concepts and engineering practices assume that some of the system elements are 
cyber resources. Resilience engineering is “the ability to build systems that can anticipate 
and circumvent accidents, survive disruptions through appropriate learning and adaptation,

and recover from disruptions by restoring the pre-disruption state as closely as possible” 
[Madni07, Madni09]. Survivability engineering can be viewed as the subset of systems 
engineering concerned with minimizing the impact of environmental disturbances on 
system performance. Survivability is defined in [Richards09] as: 

 “…the ability of a system to minimize the impact of a finite-duration disturbance on 
value delivery (i.e., stakeholder benefit at cost), achieved through (1) the reduction of the 
likelihood or magnitude of a disturbance; (2) the satisfaction of a minimally acceptable 
level of value delivery during and after a disturbance; and/or (3) a timely recovery.” 

Cyber resiliency engineering draws upon concepts and design principles from resilience 
engineering and survivability engineering. However, as discussed further in Section D.4, the 
threat model for cyber resiliency differs from the model typically used in these specialty 
engineering disciplines, which assume detectable disruptions. The concepts and design 
principles for survivability and resilience are adapted or extended to reflect malicious cyber 
activities that can remain undetected for extended periods. 

• 
Cyber Survivability 
Cyber survivability is defined in [Pitcher19], [Pitcher21], and [JCS17] as: 

“…the ability of warfighter systems to prevent, mitigate, recover from and adapt to 
adverse cyber-events that could impact mission-related functions by applying a risk-
managed approach to achieve and maintain an operationally-relevant risk posture, 
throughout its life cycle.” 

Cyber survivability is defined for warfighter systems (e.g., weapons systems, supporting 
critical infrastructures) and, in that context, is conceptually identical to cyber resiliency. 

Engineering for cyber survivability focuses on defining and evaluating Cyber Survivability 
Attributes (CSAs), which are system capabilities that support and serve as indicators of cyber 
survivability. The CSAs align with the cyber resiliency goals: CSA01-06 with Anticipate, 
CSA07-08 with Withstand, CSA09 with Recover, and CSA10 with Adapt. Many CSAs depend 
on the same security measures and other functionality as cyber resiliency techniques and 
implementation approaches (e.g., performance monitoring; identity, credential, and access 
management; and logging and auditing). Systems engineers can employ cyber resiliency 
techniques in the design and implementation of a system to provide the CSA-required 
functionality or to make that functionality more effective against threat actions.103 

• 
Reliability 
Reliability is defined as “the ability of a system or component to function under stated 
conditions for a specified period of time” [IEEE90]. Reliability engineering shares many 
analytic techniques with safety engineering but focuses on failures of systems or system 
components rather than on potential harms. Cyber resiliency engineering assumes that 
reliability, including the consideration of degradation and failure, is addressed in the overall 
systems engineering process. The threat model, including the stated conditions for 
reliability, typically does not include deliberate adversarial behavior and necessarily 
excludes new and unanticipated attack methods developed by advanced adversaries. 

 

103 The CSA tool created by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) [Reilly19] captures relationships between 
controls and control enhancements in [SP 800-53], which support cyber resiliency (see Table E.1) and the CSAs. The 
CSA tool also captures the mappings of cyber resiliency controls and implementation approaches to ATT&CK 
techniques (see Appendix F).

• 
Fault Tolerance 
A fault-tolerant system is one with “the built-in capability to provide continued, correct 
execution of its assigned function in the presence of a hardware and/or software fault” [SP 
800-82]. Classes of faults include development faults, physical faults, and interaction faults. 
Faults can be characterized by the phase of creation or occurrence whether they are 
internal or external to a system, natural or human-made, or in hardware, software, 
persistence, and properties related to human-made faults [Avizienis04]. An advanced 
adversary can cause, emulate, or take advantage of a fault. Cyber resiliency engineering 
draws some techniques or approaches104 from fault tolerance and leverages these 
capabilities while assuming that the actions of an advanced adversary may go undetected. 

The analytic processes and practices related to cyber resiliency are intended to be integrated 
with those for other specialty engineering disciplines, including security, systems engineering, 
resilience engineering, safety, cybersecurity, and mission assurance. Examples of analytic 
practices from these disciplines include: 

• 
Security, Information Security, and Cybersecurity: Operations security (OPSEC) analysis (see 
SC-38 in [SP 800-53]), information security risk analysis [SP 800-30], coverage analysis with 
respect to a taxonomy of attack events or TTPs [DHSCDM], attack tree or attack graph 
analysis, attack surface analysis, adversary emulation [MITRE21], and Red Team or 
penetration testing analysis 

• 
Resilience Engineering: Criticality Analysis [IR 8179], Mission Impact Analysis (MIA), 
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) [SP 800-34], fault tree analysis, and Failure Modes, Effects, 
and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) 

• 
Systems Engineering: Modeling and simulation (M&S), model-based systems engineering 
(MBSE), and Functional Dependency Network Analysis (FDNA) 

• 
Safety: Fault tree analysis, FMECA, System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), and Systems-
Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) [Leveson12] 

• 
Mission Assurance: Crown Jewels Analysis (CJA), mission thread analysis, cyber mission 
impact analysis (CMIA), and supply chain risk management (SCRM) analysis [SP 800-161] 

These existing analytic practices are extensible (and in practice have been extended) to include 
cyber resiliency concepts and concerns, particularly the growing concern that an advanced 
adversary can establish a covert and persistent presence on a specific system of interest, an 
enabling system, or another system in the environment of operation of the system of interest. 
Additional analytic practices include structured analysis of the system architecture and design 
with respect to cyber resiliency design principles, techniques, and approaches and adaptation of 
coverage analysis to include effects on adversary activities described in Appendix F. 

C.4   RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYBER RESILIENCY AND RISK 

Cyber resiliency solutions are intended to reduce the risk to missions or business functions, 
organizations, and individuals that depend on systems containing cyber resources. This cyber 
risk arises in several ways. For example, cyber resources and the systems that incorporate those

resources are increasingly complex, so their behavior and properties in the presence of adversity 
(or even under expected levels of stress) can be difficult to predict. Software generally includes 
vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can make it fragile and subject to exploitation by an 
adversary. Additionally, the presence of resources in cyberspace exposes them to cyber-
attacks.105  

Cyber resiliency solutions are intended to reduce the risk of depending on systems that contain 
cyber resources by reducing the extent of the harm from threat events,106 the likelihood of the 
occurrence of threat events, and the likelihood that threat events will cause harm.107 The risk 
model for cyber resiliency identifies the types of threat events and the classes of harm of 
interest to systems security engineers concerned with cyber resiliency. The extent of potential 
risk mitigation due to a cyber resiliency solution can be analyzed and assessed in the context of 
that risk model.  

The risk model for cyber resiliency builds on risk models for security, cybersecurity, resilience 
engineering, and survivability. However, the cyber resiliency risk model emphasizes the APT and 
the effects on missions and organizations of malicious cyber activities or of harm to systems that 
include cyber resources. Thus, the threat model and the consequence model components of the 
cyber resiliency threat model have distinctive characteristics. 

The threat model for cyber resiliency encompasses conventional security threat models that 
consider threat sources, including accident and human error, structural failure of system 
elements or supporting infrastructures, natural disasters, and deliberate human actions 
(including those by malicious insiders). Similarly, the threat model for cyber resiliency 
encompasses typical cybersecurity risk models.108 However, the cyber resiliency threat model 
emphasizes the APT as a primary or secondary threat source. As a primary threat source, 
sophisticated adversaries execute cyber campaigns that can involve multiple systems and 
organizations and extend for periods of months or even years.109 In addition, these adversaries 
can use TTPs typical of less sophisticated cyber threat actors. As a secondary threat source, the 
APT can take advantage of threat events due to infrastructure failure or natural disasters and 
imitate or leverage human error or the loss of component reliability. Therefore, when cyber 
resiliency engineering analysis considers a potential disruption with a non-adversarial source, 
that analysis includes looking for ways in which the APT could take advantage of the disruption. 

 

105 The risk due to the potential for a cyber-attack (i.e., an attack via cyberspace that targets an organization’s use of 
cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment or 
infrastructure; destroying the integrity of data; or stealing controlled information [SP 800-39]) is also referred to as 
cybersecurity risk [NIST CSF]. 

106 The term threat event refers to an event or situation that has the potential for causing undesirable consequences 
or impacts. Threat events can be caused by either adversarial or non-adversarial threat sources [SP 800-30]. 

107 While many different risk models are potentially valid and useful, three elements are common across most 
models: the likelihood of occurrence, the likelihood of impact, and the level of the impact [SP 800-30]. 

108  [EO 13800] states that “cybersecurity risk management comprises the full range of activities undertaken to 
protect IT and data from unauthorized access and other cyber threats, to maintain awareness of cyber threats, to 
detect anomalies and incidents adversely affecting IT and data, and to mitigate the impact of, respond to, and recover 
from incidents.” While the term cyber threat is used without definition in such sources as [EO 13800], [ODNI17], 
[DSB13], and [DHSCDM], its use (without the qualification of “advanced”) generally implies that the cyber threat actor 
attacks via cyberspace.  

109 Activities and threat events can be obtained from [MITRE18] or [SP 800-30] with augmentation or additional detail 
from other sources. The stages or phases of a cyber-attack can be obtained from [MITRE18] or [ODNI17].

The consequence model for cyber resiliency encompasses consequences to information and 
information systems (i.e., a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, as defined in [FIPS 
199]). These general consequences can be translated into more specific harms to information 
and systems that include or are enabled by cyber resources: degraded or disrupted functionality 
or performance; modified, corrupted, or fabricated information; usurped or misused system 
resources; or exfiltrated or exposed information. However, the consequence model for cyber 
resiliency also considers the potential consequences to the missions or business functions 
supported by the system, to the organization, and sometimes to other stakeholders (e.g., 
individuals whose personal information may be exfiltrated or exposed, members of the public 
affected by environmental harms resulting from the failure of a critical infrastructure system). In 
general, a cyber resiliency solution identified and implemented for a given scope is intended to 
reduce risks at the next level; for example, implementing a solution at the system level can 
mitigate risks to mission or business functions.  

Consequences to a mission or business function or to an organization can be defined in terms of 
impacts on the performance of required functions or on preserving required properties. The risk 
model for cyber resiliency, therefore, aligns well with mission risk models [Musman18]. It can 
also be used in conjunction with risk models that represent quality properties, such as security, 
survivability, and resilience.110 

• 
Security: The threat model for cyber resiliency encompasses the security threat model but 
emphasizes the APT. Depending on how broadly (e.g., all stakeholder trustworthiness 
concerns) or narrowly (e.g., specific stakeholder concerns for confidentiality, integrity, or 
availability) security is construed, the cyber resiliency consequence model can coincide with 
or include the security consequence model. The consequence model requires the systems 
engineers analyzing risks to view the system of interest in terms of how its environment of 
operation111 imposes constraints and also how adversity involving cyber resources and, 
consequently, the system of interest affect that environment.  

• 
Resilience engineering and survivability: The threat model for resilience engineering and 
survivability focuses on an event or a set of circumstances that disrupts performance. 
Survivability considers finite-duration events, while resilience engineering also considers 
multiple or repeated events and changes in the operational environment. In either case, the 
threat model implicitly assumes that the event or its immediate consequences can be 
detected. The threat model for cyber resiliency, by contrast, assumes that an advanced 
adversary can operate covertly in the system for an extended period before causing a 
detectable disruption. The consequence model is also different. Adversary-caused harms, 
such as the fabrication of user accounts or the exfiltration of sensitive information, may be 
non-disruptive. Disruption of normal system performance may, in fact, result from defensive 
actions taken after such harms are detected (e.g., removing compromised or suspect 
components from the system). Thus, the consequence model for cyber resiliency 
encompasses the consequence model for resilience and survivability.

 

110 Quality properties are emergent properties of systems that may include safety, security, maintainability, resilience, 
reliability, availability, agility, and survivability [SP 800-160 v1]. These properties are also referred to as systemic 
properties across many engineering domains. 

111 See Figure 2 in [SP 800-160 v1].

APPENDIX D 

CYBER RESILIENCY CONSTRUCTS 
ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK CONSTRUCTS AND RELATIONSHIPS 

his appendix provides an in-depth description of the cyber resiliency constructs that are 
part of the cyber resiliency engineering framework. The constructs include cyber resiliency 
goals, objectives, techniques, implementation approaches, strategic design principles, and 
structural design principles. The appendix also describes the relationships among constructs to 
assist stakeholders in the application of the constructs. 

D.1   CYBER RESILIENCY GOALS 

Cyber resiliency, similar to security, is a concern at multiple levels in an organization. The cyber 
resiliency goals (i.e., anticipate, withstand, recover, and adapt) support the linkage between the 
risk management decisions at the mission or business process and system levels and the 
organization’s risk management strategy [SP 800-39]. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FIGURE D-1:  ORGANIZATION-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

To address cyber resiliency, an organization’s risk management strategy needs to include its 
threat-framing with respect to cyber threats, its strategies for achieving cyber resiliency goals, 
and its choice of factors to use when prioritizing and interpreting cyber resiliency objectives at 
the mission or business process level and at the system level. Strategies for achieving cyber 
resiliency goals include: 

• 
Anticipate: Deterrence, avoidance, and prevention are strategies for anticipating potential 
threats. Other strategies include planning (i.e., identifying available resources and creating 
plans for using those resources if a threat materializes), preparation (i.e., changing the set of 
available resources and exercising plans), and morphing (i.e., changing the system on an 
ongoing basis in order to change the attack surface).

• 
Withstand: Strategies for withstanding the realization of potential threats, even when those 
threats are not detected, include absorption (i.e., accepting some level of damage to a given 
set of system elements, taking actions to reduce the impacts to other system elements or to 
the system as a whole, and repairing damage automatically), deflection (i.e., transferring 
threat events or their effects to different system elements or to systems other than those 
that were targeted or initially affected), and discarding (i.e., removing system elements or 
even a system as a whole based on indications of damage and either replacing those 
elements or enabling the system or mission or business process to operate without them). 

• 
Recover: Strategies for recovery include reversion (i.e., replicating a prior state that is 
known to be acceptable), reconstitution (i.e., replicating critical and supporting functions to 
an acceptable level or using existing system resources), and replacement (i.e., replacing 
damaged, suspect, or selected system elements with new ones or repurposing existing 
system elements to serve different functions in order to perform critical and supporting 
functions, possibly in different ways). Detection can support the selection of a recovery 
strategy. However, a system can apply these strategies independent of detection to change 
the attack surface. 

• 
Adapt: Strategies for adaptation include correction (i.e., removing or applying new controls 
to compensate for identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses), hardening (i.e., reducing or 
manipulating attack surfaces), and reorientation (i.e., proactively orienting controls, 
practices, and capabilities to prospective, emerging, or potential threats). These strategies 
may result in redefinition (i.e., changing the system’s requirements, architecture, design, 
configuration, acquisition processes, or operational processes). 

The organizational risk management strategy includes aspects that can limit the set of cyber 
resiliency solutions it will consider. These aspects include:112  

• 
The organization’s risk mitigation philosophy (e.g., following standards and guidelines, 
incorporating state-of-the-art technologies and making trade-offs between standards and 
leading-edge protection technologies, pushing the state-of-the-art through cyber defense 
DevOps) 

• 
Dependencies and interactions among the organization’s programs, initiatives, and other 
efforts at multiple levels that involve investment in, transition to, or use of cyber 
technologies (e.g., transition to a zero trust architecture) 

• 
The types of external coordination in which the organization will participate (e.g., consumer 
of threat intelligence, bi-directional threat information-sharing, cooperation or coordination 
to counter threats, collaboration) 

• 
Whether and how deception can be used 

D.2   CYBER RESILIENCY OBJECTIVES 

Table D-1 provides representative examples of sub-objectives for each cyber resiliency objective 
defined in Table 3. A sub-objective motivates the definition of requirements and the selection 
and tailoring of controls. The representative sub-objectives can be used as a starting point for 
eliciting restatements of objectives and for defining metrics, as illustrated in the table. The

D.3   CYBER RESILIENCY TECHNIQUES 

This section provides definitions for cyber resiliency techniques, one of the fundamental cyber 
resiliency constructs, which also include goals, objectives, approaches, and design principles. 
The objectives support goals, the techniques support objectives, the approaches support 
techniques, and the design principles support the realization of the goals and objectives. The 
relationship among the cyber resiliency constructs, including specific mapping tables for the 
constructs, is provided in Section D.6. Table D-2 lists each cyber resiliency technique and its 
purpose. Table D-3 identifies potential interactions (e.g., synergies, conflicts) between cyber 
resiliency techniques.

TECHNIQUE 
PURPOSE 

ADAPTIVE RESPONSE 

Definition: Implement agile courses of 
action to manage risks. 

Optimize the ability to respond in a timely and appropriate manner 
to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or indicators of these, thus 
maximizing the ability to maintain mission or business operations, 
limit consequences, and avoid destabilization. 

ANALYTIC MONITORING 

Definition: Monitor and analyze a wide 
range of properties and behaviors on an 
ongoing basis and in a coordinated way. 

Maximize the ability to detect potential adverse conditions; reveal 
the extent of adverse conditions, stresses, or attacks; identify 
potential or actual damage, and investigate adversary TTPs. Provide 
the data needed for situational awareness.

TECHNIQUE 
PURPOSE 

CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS 

Definition: Construct and maintain 
current representations of the posture of 
organizational missions or business 
functions while considering threat events 
and courses of action. 

Support situational awareness. Enhance understanding of 
dependencies among cyber and non-cyber resources. Reveal 
patterns or trends in adversary behavior.  

COORDINATED PROTECTION 

Definition: Ensure that protection 
mechanisms operate in a coordinated and 
effective manner. 

Require a threat event to overcome multiple safeguards (i.e., employ 
a strategy of defense-in-depth). In the case of an adversarial threat 
event, increase the difficulty for an adversary to successfully attack 
critical resources by increasing the cost to the adversary and raising 
the likelihood of adversary detection. Regardless of the type of 
threat event, ensure that the use of any given protection mechanism 
does not create adverse, unintended consequences by interfering 
with other protection mechanisms. Validate the realism of cyber 
courses of action. 

DECEPTION 

Definition: Mislead, confuse, hide critical 
assets from, or expose covertly tainted 
assets to the adversary. 

Mislead, confuse, or hide critical assets from the adversary, thereby 
making the adversary uncertain of how to proceed, delaying the 
effect of the attack, increasing the risk of being discovered, causing 
the adversary to misdirect or waste its resources, and exposing the 
adversary tradecraft prematurely. 

DIVERSITY 

Definition: Use heterogeneity to minimize 
common mode failures, particularly threat 
events exploiting common vulnerabilities. 

Limit the possibility of the loss of critical functions due to the failure 
of replicated common critical components. In the case of an 
adversarial threat event, cause an adversary to expend more effort 
by developing malware or other TTPs that are appropriate for 
multiple targets; increase the probability that the adversary will 
waste or expose TTPs by applying them to targets for which they are 
inappropriate; and maximize the probability that some of the 
defending organization’s systems will survive the adversary’s attack. 

DYNAMIC POSITIONING 

Definition: Distribute and dynamically 
relocate functionality or system 
resources. 

Increase the ability to rapidly recover from non-adversarial events 
(e.g., fires, floods) as well as from adversarial threat events (e.g., 
cyber-attacks). Impede an adversary’s ability to locate, eliminate, or 
corrupt mission or business assets, and cause the adversary to spend 
more time and effort finding the organization’s critical assets, 
thereby increasing the probability of the adversary revealing their 
presence, actions, and tradecraft prematurely. 

NON-PERSISTENCE 

Definition: Generate and retain resources 
as needed or for a limited time. 

Reduce exposure to corruption, modification, or compromise. In the 
case of adversarial threat events, provide a means of curtailing an 
adversary’s intrusion and advance and potentially removing malware 
or damaged resources from the system. Limit the availability of 
resources the adversary could target. 

PRIVILEGE RESTRICTION 

Definition: Restrict privileges based on 
the attributes of users and system 
elements as well as on environmental 
factors. 

Limit the impact and probability that unintended actions by 
authorized individuals will compromise information or services. 
Impede an adversary by requiring them to invest more time and 
effort in obtaining credentials. Curtail the adversary’s ability to take 
full advantage of credentials that they have obtained.

TECHNIQUE 
PURPOSE 

REALIGNMENT 

Definition: Structure systems and 
resource uses to meet mission or business 
function needs, reduce current and 
anticipated risks, and accommodate the 
evolution of technical, operational, and 
threat environments. 

Minimize the connections between mission-critical and non-critical 
services, thus reducing the likelihood that a failure of non-critical 
services will impact mission-critical services. Reduce the attack 
surface of the defending organization by minimizing the probability 
that non-mission or business functions could be used as an attack 
vector. Accommodate changing mission or business function needs. 
Accommodate changes in the technical environment. 

REDUNDANCY 

Definition: Provide multiple protected 
instances of critical resources. 

Reduce the consequences of the loss of information or services. 
Facilitate recovery from the effects of an adverse cyber event. Limit 
the time during which critical services are denied or limited. 

SEGMENTATION 

Definition: Define and separate system 
elements based on criticality and 
trustworthiness. 

Contain adversary activities and non-adversarial stresses (e.g., fires, 
floods) to the enclave, system segment, or facility in which they have 
established a presence. Limit the set of possible targets to which 
malware can be easily propagated. 

SUBSTANTIATED INTEGRITY 

Definition: Ascertain whether critical 
system elements have been corrupted. 

Facilitate the determination of correct results in case of conflicts 
between diverse services or inputs. Detect attempts by an adversary 
to deliver compromised data, software, or hardware, as well as 
successful modification or fabrication. 

UNPREDICTABILITY 

Definition: Make changes randomly or 
unpredictably. 

Increase an adversary’s uncertainty regarding the system protections 
that they may encounter, thus making it more difficult for them to 
ascertain the appropriate course of action. Serve as a force multiplier 
for other techniques.

D.4   CYBER RESILIENCY IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES 

This section identifies representative cyber resiliency approaches to implementing cyber 
resiliency techniques. A cyber resiliency approach is a subset of the technologies and processes 
included in a cyber resiliency technique and is defined by how the capabilities are implemented 
or how the intended consequences are achieved. Table D-4 lists each cyber resiliency technique, 
representative approaches that can be used to implement the technique, and representative 
examples. Where possible, examples are drawn from discussions associated with the controls 
and control enhancements in [SP 800-53], even when these controls or enhancements do not 
directly support cyber resiliency as described in Appendix E. However, [SP 800-53] does not 
address all approaches or all aspects of any individual approach. Therefore, some examples are 
drawn from system reliability and system resilience practices and technologies and/or from 
emerging cyber resiliency technologies. The set of approaches for a specific technique is not 
exhaustive and represents relatively mature technologies and practices. Thus, technologies 
emerging from research can be characterized in terms of the techniques they apply while not 
being covered by any of the representative approaches.

adversary activities there. 

Informal description: Direct adversary 
activities to deception environments 
or resources. 

Discussion: Commercial products can 
be used to create and maintain a 
deception network, but ongoing 
effort is needed to keep it current, 
engage with adversaries, and analyze 
adversary TTPs. 

• Establish and maintain honeypots, 

honeynets, or decoy files. 

• Maintain a full-scale, all-

encompassing deception 
environment. 

TAINTING 

Definition: Embed covert capabilities 
in resources.  

Informal description: Make whatever 
adversaries steal also identify those 
adversaries or even harm them.  

Discussion: Enable exfiltrated data to

poisoning (e.g., Domain Name System 
[DNS], Address Resolution Protocol 
[ARP]).

steganographic data in files to enable 
them to be found via open-source 
analysis. 

 

115 The Deception technique could more properly be described as Deception and Denial (D&D). The implementation 
approaches for deception correspond to the D&D framework provided by [Heckman15]: Obfuscation – Conceal Facts; 
Disinformation – Reveal Fictions; Misdirection – Conceal Fictions; and Tainting – Reveal Facts. To avoid any possible 
confusion with denial of service (DoS), the technique is referred to simply as Deception.

TECHNIQUES 
APPROACHES 
EXAMPLES 

DIVERSITY 

Definition: Use heterogeneity 
to minimize common mode 
failures, particularly threat 
events that exploit common 
vulnerabilities. 

Discussion: Enterprise 
systems often include some 
incidental diversity as a result 
of procurements by different 
programs or at different 
times. Poorly managed, this 
can be costly and create 
security risks; well managed, 
it can make an adversary’s job 
harder. Due to reliance on 
common libraries and 
infrastructures, diversity can 
be more apparent than real. 
Therefore, analysis is needed 
to verify the extent of 
diversity. 

ARCHITECTURAL DIVERSITY 

Definition: Use multiple sets of 
technical standards, different 
technologies, and different 
architectural patterns.

airplanes and lighter-than-air aircraft 
for air transportation. 

DESIGN DIVERSITY

within a given architecture to meet 
the same requirements or provide 
equivalent functionality.  

Informal description: Provide 
multiple ways to meet requirements. 

Discussion: Within the context of a 
given architecture, parallel design 
teams can solve the same problem in 
different ways, thus producing 
different attack surfaces. 

• Employ N-version programming. 

• Employ mixed-signal design diversity 

(using both analog and digital signals). 

• Employ mixed-level design diversity 

(using both hardware and software 
implementations).

helium-filled and hot air dirigibles. 

SYNTHETIC DIVERSITY 

Definition: Transform 
implementations of software to 
produce a variety of instances.

Discussion: Use of information from 
different sources can reveal adversary 
injection or modification. 

• Apply different analog-to-digital 

conversion methods to non-digitally-
obtained data. 

• Use multiple data sources. 

PATH DIVERSITY 

Definition: Provide multiple 
independent paths for command, 
control, and communications. 

Informal description: Do not rely on a 
single mode of communication. 

Discussion: In particular, ensure 
alternative lines of communications

telecommunications services (e.g., 
ground-based circuits, satellite 
communications). 

• Employ alternate communications 

protocols. 

• Use out-of-band channels.

As the examples in Table D-4 illustrate, cyber resiliency techniques and approaches can be 
applied at a variety of architectural layers or system elements, including elements of the 
technical system (e.g., hardware, networking, software, and information stores) and system 
elements that are part of the larger socio-technical system: operations (e.g., people and 
processes supporting cyber defense, system administration, and mission or business function 
tasks), support (e.g., programmatic, systems engineering, maintenance, and sustainment), and 
environment of operation (e.g., physical access restrictions and physical location). For a 
representative set of architectural layers, Table D-5 indicates approaches that could be applied 
at those layers. In Table D-5, “other software” includes specialized software intended to 
implement cyber resiliency or cybersecurity capabilities. Some approaches (e.g., Calibrated 
Defense-in-Depth, Consistency Analysis) can involve working across multiple layers or at 
multiple locations.

D.5   CYBER RESILIENCY DESIGN PRINCIPLES 

This section provides a description of strategic and structural cyber resiliency design principles—
key constructs in the cyber resiliency engineering framework. It also describes relationships with 
the design principles from other disciplines, the analytic practices necessary to implement the 
principles, and how the application of the principles affects risk. In particular, relationships to 
security design principles as described in [SP 800-160 v1] are identified.116 As noted in Section 
2.1.4, strategic design principles express the organization’s risk management strategy, and 
structural design principles support the strategic design principles.  

D.5.1   Strategic Design Principles 

Strategic cyber resiliency design principles guide and inform engineering analyses and risk 
analyses throughout the system life cycle and highlight different structural design principles, 
cyber resiliency techniques, and approaches to applying those techniques. Table D-6 describes 

 

116 [SP 800-160 v1] defines security design principles in three broad categories: Security Architecture and Design, 
Security Capability and Intrinsic Behaviors, and Life Cycle Security. For a detailed discussion of relationships between 
security design principles and cyber resiliency techniques as well as cyber resiliency design principles, see [Bodeau17].

FOCUS ON COMMON 
CRITICAL ASSETS. 

 

Motivation: Limited organizational and 
programmatic resources need to be 
applied where they can provide the 
greatest benefit. This results in a strategy 
of focusing first on assets that are both 
critical and common followed by those 
that are either critical or common. 

Guidance: Know which mission or 
business functions, tasks, capabilities, 
and assets are critical. Know which 
resources, assets, or services are 
essential to the successful performance 
of critical functions and tasks or to the 
protection of critical assets. Focus first 
on ensuring the security and cyber 
resiliency of those essential resources 
that are common across multiple 
functions as high-value adversary 
targets. 

Security: Inverse Modification 
Threshold. 

Resilience Engineering: Physical 
Redundancy, Layered Defense, Loose 
Coupling. 

Survivability: Failure Mode Reduction, 
Fail-Safe, Evolution. 

 

117 Resilience Engineering design principles are described in the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge [SEBoK] and 
[Jackson13]. Resilience Engineering design principles mapped to cyber resiliency design principles in this appendix 
are: Absorption (allow the system to withstand threats to a specified level), Human-in-the-Loop (allow the system to 
employ human elements when there is a need for human cognition), Internode Interaction (allow the nodes of the 
system to communicate, cooperate, and collaborate with other nodes when this interaction is essential), Modularity 
(construct the system of relatively independent but interlocking system components or system elements; also called 
Localized Capacity), Neutral State (allow the system to incorporate time delays that will allow human operators to 
consider actions to prevent further damage), Complexity Avoidance (incorporate features that enable the system to 
limit its own complexity to a level not more than necessary), Hidden Interactions Avoidance (incorporate features 
that assure that potentially harmful interactions between nodes are avoided), Redundancy [functional] (employ an 
architecture with two or more independent and identical branches), Redundancy [physical] (employ an architecture 
with two or more different branches; also called Diversity), Loose Coupling (construct the system of elements that 
depend on each other to the least extent practicable), Defense-in-Depth (provide multiple means to avoid failure; also 
called Layered Defense), Restructuring (incorporate features that allow the system to restructure itself; also known as 
Reorganization), and Reparability (incorporate features that allow the system to be brought up to partial or full 
functionality over a specified period of time and in a specified environment). 

118 Survivability design principles are described in [Richards08]. The Survivability design principles mapped to cyber 
resiliency design principles in this appendix are: Prevention (suppress a future or potential future disturbance); 
Mobility (relocate to avoid detection by an external change agent), Concealment (reduce the visibility of a system 
from an external change agent), Deterrence (dissuade a rational external agent from committing a disturbance), 
Preemption (suppress an imminent disturbance), Avoidance (maneuver away from an ongoing disturbance), Hardness 
(resist deformation), Redundancy (duplicate critical system functions to increase reliability), Margin (allow extra 
capabilities to maintain value delivery despite losses), Heterogeneity (vary system elements to mitigate homogeneous 
disturbances), Distribution (separate critical system elements to mitigate local disturbances), Failure Mode Reduction 
(eliminate system hazards through intrinsic design: substitute, simplify, decouple, and reduce hazardous materials), 
Fail-Safe (prevent or delay degradation via physics of incipient failure), Evolution (alter system elements to reduce 
disturbance effectiveness), Containment (isolate or minimize the propagation of failure), Replacement (substitute 
system elements to improve value delivery), and Repair (restore the system to improve value delivery).

FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES 

SUPPORT AGILITY AND 
ARCHITECT FOR 
ADAPTABILITY. 

Motivation: Not only does the threat 
landscape change as adversaries evolve, 
so do technologies and the ways in 
which individuals and organizations use 
them. Both agility and adaptability are 
integral to the risk management strategy 
in response to the risk framing 
assumption that unforeseen changes will 
occur in the threat, technical, and 
operational environment through a 
system’s lifespan. 

Guidance: Prepare for changes in the 
technical, operational, and threat 
environments. Leverage existing and 
emerging standards to support 
interoperability. Recognizing that the 
organization could invest in capabilities 
or create programs for varying purposes 
and with different time frames, manage 
risks due to dependencies or other 
interactions among programs or 
initiatives. 

Security: Secure Evolvability, Minimized 
Sharing, Reduced Complexity, Secure 
System Modification. 

Resilience Engineering: Reorganization, 
Human Backup, Inter-Node Interaction. 

Survivability: Mobility, Evolution. 

REDUCE ATTACK 
SURFACES. 

Motivation: A large attack surface is 
difficult to defend and requires ongoing 
effort to monitor, analyze, and respond 
to anomalies. Reducing attack surfaces 
reduces ongoing protection scope costs 
and makes the adversary concentrate 
efforts on a small set of locations, 
resources, or environments that can be 
more effectively monitored and 
defended. 

Guidance: Understand the organization’s 
attack surfaces—not only the exposed 
elements of systems but also people and 
processes. Consider how an adversary 
could attack development, operational, 
and maintenance environments. 
Consider attack surfaces in the cyber 
supply chain. Consider social media 
exposure and insider threats. 

Security: Least Common Mechanism, 
Minimized Sharing, Reduced 
Complexity, Minimized Security 
Elements, Least Privilege, Predicate 
Permission. 

Resilience Engineering: Complexity 
Avoidance, Drift Correction. 

Survivability: Prevention, Failure Mode 
Reduction. 

ASSUME COMPROMISED 
RESOURCES. 

Motivation: Systems and system 
components, ranging from chips to 
software modules to running services, 
can be compromised for extended 
periods without detection. In fact, some 
compromises may never be detected. 
Nonetheless, systems must remain 
capable of meeting performance and 
quality requirements. 

Guidance: Structure systems and mission 
or business processes to minimize the 
harm that could result from a specific 

Security: Trusted Components, Self-
Reliant Trustworthiness, Trusted 
Communications Channels. 
Incompatible with Security: Hierarchical 
Protection.

product or type of technology being 
compromised. Consider the potential for 
lateral movement by an adversary as 
well as for cascading failures. Analyze 
and prepare to manage the potential 
consequences of learning that a key 
component, service, or technology has 
been compromised or found vulnerable. 

EXPECT ADVERSARIES TO 
EVOLVE. 

Motivation: Advanced cyber adversaries 
invest time, effort, and intelligence 
gathering to improve existing TTPs and 
develop new TTPs. Adversaries evolve in 
response to opportunities offered by 
new technologies or uses of technology, 
as well as to the knowledge they gain 
about defender TTPs. In time, the tools 
developed by advanced adversaries 
become available to less sophisticated 
adversaries. Therefore, systems and 
missions need to be resilient in the face 
of unexpected attacks. 

Guidance: Incorporate an adversarial 
perspective when analyzing architectural 
changes, design modifications, and 
changes in operational procedures and 
governance structures. Use cyber threat 
intelligence (CTI) but do not be limited 
by it—take a longer-term view, and 
expect the threat landscape to continue 
to change. 

Security: Trusted Communications 
Channels. 

Resilience Engineering: Reorganization, 
Drift Correction. 

Survivability: Evolution. 

 
 
Strategic design principles are driven by an organization’s risk management strategy and, in 
particular, by its risk framing. Risk framing may include assumptions about the threats the 
organization should be prepared for, the constraints on risk management decision-making 
(including which risk response alternatives are irrelevant), and organizational priorities and 
trade-offs.119 From the standpoint of cyber resiliency, one way to express priorities is in terms of 
which cyber resiliency objectives are most important. Each strategic design principle supports 
the achievement of one or more cyber resiliency objectives and relates to the design principles, 
concerns, or analysis processes associated with other specialty engineering disciplines. The 
relationships between strategic cyber resiliency design principles, risk framing, and analytic 
practices are indicated in Table D-7. Relationships between design principles and other cyber 
resiliency constructs are identified in Section D.6.

Sections D.5.1.1 through D.5.1.5 provide descriptions of the strategic cyber resiliency principles. 

D.5.1.1   Focus on Common Critical Assets 

A focus on critical assets (i.e., resources valued due to their importance to mission or business 
accomplishment)120 is central to contingency planning, continuity of operations planning, 
operational resilience, and safety analysis. Critical assets can be identified using a variety of 
mission-oriented analysis techniques, including Mission Impact Analysis (MIA), Business Impact 
Analysis (BIA),121 Functional Dependency Network Analysis (FDNA), Crown Jewels Analysis (CJA), 
and Mission Thread Analysis. In some instances, failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis 
(FMECA) can reflect a safety-oriented approach. 

Assets that are common to multiple missions or business functions are potential high-value 
targets for adversaries either because those assets are critical or because their compromise 
increases the adversaries’ options for lateral motion122 or persistence [OMB M-19-03]. Once an 
asset is identified as critical or common, further analysis involves: 

 

120 Critical assets may also be referred to as high-value assets (HVA) in accordance with [OMB M-19-03]. 

121 See [SP 800-34]. 

122 Lateral motion refers to an adversary’s ability to move transitively from one system element to another system 
element or in a system-of-systems from one constituent system to another constituent system.

• 
Identifying how the asset is used in different operational contexts (e.g., normal operations, 
abnormal operations, crisis or emergency operations, failover). An asset that is common to 
multiple missions may be critical to one mission in one context but not in a second or critical 
to a second mission only in the second context.  

• 
Determining which properties or attributes make the asset critical (e.g., correctness, non-
observability, availability) or high value (e.g., providing access to a set of critical system 
elements, providing information that could be used in further malicious cyber activities) and 
what would constitute an acceptable (e.g., safe, secure) failure mode. Again, properties that 
are critical to one mission may be nonessential to another, and a failure mode that is 
acceptable from the standpoint of security may be unacceptable from the standpoint of 
safety. 

• 
Determining which strategies to use to ensure critical properties, taking into consideration 
the different usage contexts and potential malicious cyber activities. Strategies for ensuring 
the correctness and non-observability properties include disabling non-critical functionality, 
restoring to default or known-good settings, and selectively isolating or disabling data flows 
to or from system components. Articulating trade-offs among critical properties and 
acceptable failure modes is central to effective risk management.  

Based on the strategy or strategies that best fit a given type of asset, the most appropriate or 
relevant structural design principles can be determined. 

This strategic design principle makes common infrastructures (e.g., networks), shared services 
(e.g., identity and access management services), and shared data repositories high priorities for 
the application of selected cyber resiliency techniques. It recognizes that the resources for risk 
mitigation are limited and enables systems engineers to focus resources where they will have 
the greatest potential impact on risk mitigation. 

D.5.1.2   Support Agility and Architect for Adaptability 

In Resilience Engineering, agility means “the effective response to opportunity and problem, 
within a mission” [Jackson07] [Sheard08]. In that context, resilience supports agility and 
counters brittleness. In the context of cyber resiliency, agility is the property of an infrastructure 
or a system that can be reconfigured, in which components can be reused or repurposed, and in 
which resources can be reallocated so that cyber defenders can define, select, and tailor cyber 
courses of action (CCoA) for a broad range of disruptions or malicious cyber activities. This 
strategy is consistent with the vision that the “infrastructure allows systems and missions to be 
reshaped nimbly to meet tactical goals or environment changes” [King12]. Agility enables 
system and operational processes to incorporate new technologies and/or adapt to changing 
adversary capabilities.  

Adaptability is the property of an architecture, a design, and/or an implementation that can 
accommodate changes to the threat model, mission or business functions, technologies, and 
systems without major programmatic impacts. A variety of strategies for agility and adaptability 
have been defined. These include modularity and controlled interfaces to support plug-and-play, 
the externalization of rules and configuration data, and the removal or disabling of unused 
components to reduce complexity. Application of this design principle early in the system life 
cycle can reduce sustainment costs and modernization efforts.

This design principle means that analyses of alternative architectures and designs need to 
search for sources of brittleness (e.g., reliance on a single operating system or communications 
channel, allowing single points of failure, reliance on proprietary interface standards, use of 
large and hard-to-analyze multi-function modules). Therefore, the analyses need to focus on 
Realignment and consider Redundancy, Adaptive Response, Diversity, and the Coordinated 
Protection capabilities that enable cyber defenders to make effective use of these techniques. In 
addition, analyses need to consider where and how to use “cyber maneuver,” or moving target 
defenses, and Deception. Finally, analyses need to consider where and how an architecture, 
design, or as-deployed system is bound to designated assumptions about the threat, 
operational, and/or technical environments. 

D.5.1.3   Reduce Attack Surfaces 

The term attack surface refers to the set of points on the boundary of a system, a system 
element, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract 
data from that system, system element, or environment. The system’s attack surface can be 
characterized as the accessible areas where weaknesses or deficiencies (including in hardware, 
software, and firmware system components) provide opportunities for adversaries to exploit 
vulnerabilities [SP 800-53] or as its exposure to reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities: any 
hardware, software, connection, data exchange, service, or removable media that might expose 
the system to potential threat access [DOD20]. 

Some uses of the term focus on externally exposed vulnerabilities (i.e., the attack surface of a 
system that connects to a network includes access control points for remote access). However, 
the assumption that an adversary will penetrate an organization’s systems means that internal 
exposures (i.e., vulnerabilities that can be reached by lateral movement within a system or 
infrastructure) are also part of the attack surface. Conceptually, the term attack surface can also 
cover aspects of the development, operational, and maintenance environments that an 
adversary can reach and that could contain vulnerabilities. The supply chain for a system can 
also present additional attack surfaces. More broadly, an organization can be said to have an 
attack surface that includes its personnel, external users of organizational systems (if any), and 
its supply chain both for mission or business operations and information and communications 
technology (ICT). To accommodate these broader interpretations of the term, the design 
principle refers to “attack surfaces.” 

This design principle is often used in conjunction with the Focus on common critical assets 
principle. Analysis of internal attack surfaces can reveal unplanned and unexpected paths to 
critical assets. It makes the identification or discovery of attack surfaces a priority in system 
design analyses,123 as well as analyses of development, configuration, and maintenance 
environments (e.g., by considering how using free and open-source software [FOSS] or 
commercial off-the-shelf [COTS] products that cannot be tailored in those environments 
expands attack surfaces). It may be infeasible in some architectures (e.g., Internet of Things, 
bring-your-own-device) or procurement environments (e.g., limited supply chain) for which the 
Assume compromised resources principle is highly relevant. 

 

123 For example, [SP 800-53] control SA-11(6), Developer Security Testing | Attack Surface Reviews, calls for the 
analysis of design and implementation changes.

As indicated in Table D-8, several alternative strategies for reducing an attack surface can be 
identified. These strategies are expressed by different controls in [SP 800-53] and apply different 
cyber resiliency techniques. In Table D-8, the bolding in the discussion of the control indicates 
how the control supports the strategy. These strategies can be reflected by different structural 
principles. For example, design decisions related to the Maximize transience and Change or 
disrupt the attack surface structural principles can reduce the duration of exposure; application 
of the Limit the need for trust principle can reduce exposure. While the controls in Table D-8 
focus on attack surfaces within a system, the strategies apply more broadly to the attack 
surfaces of a mission or an organization. For example, Operations Security (OPSEC) can reduce 
exposure of the mission or organization to adversary reconnaissance. Supply chain protections 
can reduce the exposure of key components to tampering.

REDUCE THE 
EXTENT OF THE 
ATTACK SURFACE. 

Attack surface reduction includes implementing the 
concept of layered defenses, applying the principles of 
least privilege and least functionality, deprecating unsafe 
functions, and applying secure software development 
practices, including reducing entry points available to 
unauthorized users, reducing the amount of code that 
executes, and eliminating application programming 
interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks.

and programmatic environments, which can change physical, supply chain, personnel, technical, 
and procedural aspects of the attack surface, as well as technical aspects. 

D.5.1.4   Assume Compromised Resources 

A significant number of system architectures treat many, if not all, resources as non-malicious. 
This assumption is particularly prevalent in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet of Things 
(IoT) architectures [Folk15]. However, systems and their components, ranging from chips to 
software modules to running services, can be compromised for extended periods without 
detection [DSB13]. In fact, some compromises may never be detected. Thus, the assumption 
that some system resources have been compromised is prudent. While the assumption that 
some resources cannot be trusted is well established from the standpoint of security (i.e., the 
compromised resources cannot be trusted to follow established security policies), the concept 
of trustworthiness is broader. By compromising a resource, an adversary can affect its reliability, 
the ability to enforce other policies, or the safety of the larger system or environment of which 
the resource is a part or can use the resource in an attack on other systems [SP 1500-201] 
[NIST16]. 

This design principle implies the need for analysis of how the system architecture reduces the 
potential consequences of a successful compromise—in particular, the duration and degree of 
adversary-caused disruption and the speed and extent of malware propagation. An increasing 
number of modeling and simulation techniques support the analysis of the potential systemic 
consequences stemming from the compromise of a given resource or set of resources. Such 
analysis includes identifying different types or forms of systemic consequences (e.g., unreliable 
or unpredictable behavior of services, unreliable or unpredictable availability of capabilities, or 
data of indeterminate quality) and subsequently linking these systemic consequences to mission 
consequences (e.g., mission failure, safety failure) or organizational consequences (e.g., loss of 
trust or reputation). 

D.5.1.5   Expect Adversaries to Evolve 

Advanced cyber adversaries invest time, effort, and intelligence gathering to improve existing 
TTPs and develop new TTPs. Adversaries evolve in response to opportunities offered by new 
technologies or uses of technology, as well as to the knowledge they gain about defender TTPs. 
In (increasingly short) time, the tools developed by advanced adversaries become available to 
less sophisticated adversaries. Therefore, systems and missions need to be resilient in the face 
of unexpected attacks. This design principle supports a risk management strategy that includes 
and goes beyond the common practice of searching for and seeking ways to remediate known 
vulnerabilities (or classes of vulnerabilities). A system that has been hardened in the sense of 
remediating known vulnerabilities will remain exposed to evolving adversaries. 

This design principle implies the need for analyses in which the adversary perspective is 
explicitly represented by intelligent actors who can play the role of an adaptive or evolving 
adversary. For implemented systems, such analyses are typically part of red teaming or war 
gaming. Analyses can use threat intelligence or repositories of attack patterns (e.g., ATT&CK 
[MITRE18], CAPEC [MITRE07]) to provide concrete examples, but care should be taken not to be 
constrained by those examples. Voice of the Adversary (VoA) is a design analysis technique in 
which one or more team members play the role of an adversary to critique alternatives by 
taking into consideration possible goals, behaviors, and cyber effects assuming varying degrees

of system access or penetration. This type of design analysis can use models or taxonomies of 
adversary behaviors (e.g., the cyber-attack life cycle or cyber kill chain models [Hutchins11], 
CAPEC [MITRE07] or ATT&CK [MITRE18] classes) and languages or taxonomies of cyber effects 
(e.g., [Temin10]). 

This design principle also highlights the value of the Deception and Diversity techniques. 
Deception can cause adversaries to reveal their TTPs prematurely from the perspective of their 
cyber campaign plans, enabling defenders to develop countermeasures or defensive TTPs. 
Diversity can force an adversary to develop a range of TTPs to achieve the same objectives. 

D.5.2   Structural Design Principles 

Structural cyber resiliency design principles guide and inform design and implementation 
decisions throughout the system life cycle. As indicated in Table D-9, many of the structural 
design principles are consistent with or leverage the design principles for security and/or 
resilience.125 The first four design principles are closely related to protection strategies and 
security design principles and can be applied in mutually supportive ways. The next three design 
principles are closely related to design principles for resilience engineering and survivability; are 
driven by the concern for an operational environment (including cyber threats), which changes 
on an ongoing basis; and are closely related to design principles for evolvability. The final four 
principles are strongly driven by the need to manage the effects of malicious cyber activities, 
even when those activities are not observed. Descriptions of how structural design principles are 
applied or could be applied to a system of interest can help stakeholders understand how their 
concerns are being addressed.

Structural design principles provide guidance for design decisions intended to reduce risk.126 
This guidance affects the selection and the application of cyber resiliency techniques. Table D-15 
describes the relationship between structural design principles and cyber resiliency techniques. 
Table D-11 briefly describes the structural design principles and identifies the intended effects 
of each structural design principle on risk.

LIMIT THE NEED FOR TRUST. 
Reduce the likelihood of harm due to malice, error, or failure. 

Discussion: Limit the number of system elements that need to be

tenets. 

CONTROL VISIBILITY AND USE. 
Reduce the likelihood of occurrence of adversarial events; reduce

Reduce the likelihood of harm due to malice, error, or failure by 
enabling responses to changes in the operational environment; 
reduce the extent of harm. 

Discussion: Risk-adaptive management supports agility and 
provides supplemental risk mitigation throughout critical operations 
despite disruptions or outages of components.

Reduce the likelihood of occurrence by reducing the time during 
which an adverse event could occur; reduce the likelihood of harm 
due to malice, error, or failure by reducing the time during which an 
event could result in harm. 

Discussion: The use of transient system elements (e.g., data, 
services, connectivity) minimizes the duration of exposure to 
adversary activities. Periodically refreshing to a known (secure) 
state can expunge malware or corrupted data. 

DETERMINE ONGOING 
TRUSTWORTHINESS. 

Reduce the likelihood of harm due to corrupted, modified, or 
fabricated information by enabling untrustworthy information to be 
identified; reduce the extent of harm by reducing the propagation 
of untrustworthy information. 

Discussion: Do not assume that the properties of a resource, 
service, process, or connection are stable over time. Perform 
periodic or ongoing verification and/or validation of properties 
related to trustworthiness, and perform ongoing monitoring and 
analysis of behavior. This principle is consistent with ZT tenets. 

CHANGE OR DISRUPT THE ATTACK 
SURFACE. 

Reduce the likelihood of occurrence by removing the circumstances 
in which an adversarial event is feasible; reduce the likelihood of 
harm due to adversarial events by making such events ineffective. 

Discussion: Disruption of the attack surface can cause the adversary 
to waste resources, make incorrect assumptions about the system 
or the defender, prematurely launch attacks, or disclose 
information. 

MAKE THE EFFECTS OF DECEPTION AND 
UNPREDICTABILITY USER-TRANSPARENT. 

Reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of errors; when Deception 
techniques are applied, reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of 
adversarial events. 

Discussion: Deception and unpredictability can be highly effective 
techniques against an adversary, leading the adversary to reveal its 
presence or TTPs or to waste effort. However, when improperly 
applied, these techniques can also confuse users.

responsibilities [CNSSI 4009]. Assertions of trustworthiness (e.g., “this software can be relied 
upon to enforce the following security policies with a high level of confidence”) are meaningless 
without some form of verification, validation, or demonstration (e.g., design analysis, testing). In 
the absence of some credible form of assurance (which can be costly and invalidated by changes 
in the system or the environment), assertions of trustworthiness constitute assumptions. 
Reducing the size of the set of trusted entities (whether individuals, software components, or 
hardware components) by minimizing assumptions about what is or can be trusted reduces the 
attack surface and lowers assurance costs.  

The application of this design principle is most effective early in the system life cycle when the 
motivation of the Prevent/Avoid objective is clearest. When a system already exists, changes to 
the operational concept (consistent with the Transform objective) or the system architecture 
(applying the Re-Architect objective and the Realignment technique) can increase costs. One 
approach to applying this design principle (using the Coordinated Protection and Privilege 
Restriction techniques) is through limitations on inheritance so that privileges or access rights 
associated with one class of system component are not automatically propagated to classes or 
instances created from the original one. While limitations on inheritance can initially increase 
the burden on developers or administrators, they can also reduce the complexity associated 
with multiple inheritance. 

This design principle supports the strategic design principles of Reduce attack surfaces and 
Assume compromised resources. However, its application increases the difficulty of applying the 
Support agility and architect for adaptability strategic design principle. This design principle can 
also be used in conjunction with Determine ongoing trustworthiness. If a system element is 
assumed or required to have a given level of trustworthiness, some attestation mechanism is 
needed to verify that it has and continues to retain that trustworthiness level. Minimizing the 
number of elements with trustworthiness requirements reduces the level of effort involved in 
determining ongoing trustworthiness. Finally, this design principle can be used in conjunction 
with Plan and manage diversity. The managed use of multiple sources of system elements, 
services, or information can enable behavior or data quality to be validated by comparison. 

D.5.2.2   Control Visibility and Use 

Controlling visibility counters adversary attempts at reconnaissance from outside or within the 
system. Thus, the adversary must exert greater effort to identify potential targets, whether for 
exfiltration, modification, or disruption. The visibility of data can be controlled by mechanisms 
such as encryption, data hiding, or data obfuscation. Visibility into how some resources are used 
can also be controlled directly, such as by adding chaff to network traffic. Visibility into the 
supply chain, development process, or system design can be limited via operations security 
(OPSEC), deception [Heckman15], and split or distributed design and manufacturing. Process 
obfuscation is an area of active research. An increasing number and variety of deception 
technologies (e.g., deception nets) can be applied at the system level. 

Controlling use counters adversary activities and actions in the Control, Execute, and Maintain 
phases of the cyber-attack life cycle [MITRE18]. To limit visibility or control use, access to system 
resources can be controlled from the perspectives of multiple security disciplines, including 
physical, logical (see the discussion of privileges below), and hybrid (e.g., physical locations in a 
geographically distributed system or in a complex, embedded system). Restrictions on access 
and use can be guided by information sensitivity, as in standard security practices. Restrictions

can also be based on criticality (i.e., the importance to achieving mission objectives). While 
some resources can be determined to be mission-critical or mission-essential a priori, the 
criticality of other resources can change dynamically. For example, a resource that is vital to one 
phase of mission processing can become unimportant after that phase is completed.  

Many systems or system components provide the capability to define and manage privileges 
associated with software, services, processes, hardware, communications channels, and 
individual users. The assignment of privileges should ideally reflect judgments of operational 
need (e.g., need-to-know, need-to-use) as well as trustworthiness. The restriction of privileges is 
well established as a security design principle (i.e., least privilege). Privilege restrictions force 
adversaries to focus efforts on a restricted set of targets, which can be assured (in the case of 
software), validated (in the case of data), or monitored (in the case of individuals, processes, 
communications channels, and services). Non-Persistence and Segmentation can also limit 
visibility. Thus, this principle can be applied in conjunction with the Contain and exclude 
behaviors and Maximize transience principles. 

D.5.2.3   Contain and Exclude Behaviors 

The behavior of a system or system element—including what resources it uses, which systems 
or system elements it interacts with, or when it takes a given action—can vary based on many 
legitimate circumstances. However, analysis of the organizational missions or business functions 
and the processes that carry out those missions and functions [SP 800-39] can identify some 
behaviors that are always unacceptable and others that are acceptable only under specific 
circumstances. Therefore, excluding behaviors prevents them from having undesirable 
consequences. Behaviors can be excluded a priori with varying degrees of assurance, from 
removing functionality to restricting functionality or use, with trade-offs between assurance and 
flexibility. For example, user activity outside of specific time windows can be precluded. In 
addition, behaviors can be interrupted based on ongoing monitoring when that monitoring 
provides a basis for suspicion. 

Containing behaviors involves restricting the set of resources or system elements that can be 
affected by the behavior of a given system element. Such restrictions can but do not necessarily 
involve a temporal aspect. Containment can be achieved a priori, via predefined privileges and 
segmentation. Alternately, or perhaps additionally, Dynamic Segmentation and Isolation and 
Adaptive Response and can be applied. For example, a sandbox or deception environment can 
be dynamically created in response to suspicious behavior, and subsequent activities can be 
diverted there. 

D.5.2.4   Layer Defenses and Partition Resources 

Defense-in-depth is the integration of people, technology, and operations capabilities to 
establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions [CNSSI 4009] and is a well-
established security strategy. It describes security architectures constructed through the 
application of multiple mechanisms to create a series of barriers to prevent, delay, or deter an 
attack by an adversary [SP 800-160 v1]. Multiple mechanisms to achieve the same objective or 
provide equivalent functionality can be used at a single layer (e.g., different COTS firewalls to 
separate zones in a DMZ) or at different layers (e.g., detection of suspicious behavior at the 
application, operating system, and network layers). To avoid inconsistencies that could result in 
errors or vulnerabilities, such (multiple) mechanisms should be managed consistently.

Layering defenses restricts the adversary’s movement vertically in a layered security 
architecture (i.e., a defense at one layer prevents a compromise at an adjacent layer from 
propagating). Partitioning (i.e., separating sets of resources into effectively separate systems) 
with controlled interfaces (e.g., cross-domain solutions) between them restricts the lateral 
movement of the adversary. Partitioning can limit the adversary’s visibility (see Control visibility 
and use) and serve to Contain and exclude behaviors. Partitioning can be based on policy and 
administration, as in security domains [SP 800-160 v1], or be informed by the organizational 
missions or business functions that the system elements in the partition support. Partitions can 
be implemented physically, logically, at the network layer, or within a platform (e.g., via hard or 
soft partitioning). Partitioning may involve limiting resource-sharing or making fewer resources 
common. If resources are replicated, the Maintain redundancy principle should be applied.  

D.5.2.5   Plan and Manage Diversity 

Diversity (usually in conjunction with Redundancy [Sterbenz14]) is a well-established technique 
for improving system resilience [Sterbenz10, Höller15]. For cyber resiliency, Diversity avoids the 
risk of system homogeneity, in which the compromise of one component can propagate to all 
other similar components. Diversity offers the benefit of providing alternative ways to deliver 
required functionality so that if a component is compromised, one or more alternative 
components that provide the same functionality can be used.  

Multiple approaches to diversity can be identified. These include architectural diversity; design 
diversity; synthetic (or automated) diversity;127 information diversity; diversity of command, 
control, and communications (C3) paths (including out-of-band communications); geographic 
diversity;128 supply chain diversity [SP 800-160 v1] [Bodeau15]; and diversity in operating 
procedures. In addition, some incidental architectural diversity often results from procurement 
over time and differing user preferences. Incidental diversity is often more apparent than real 
(i.e., different products can present significantly different interfaces to administrators or users 
while incorporating identical components). 

However, diversity can be problematic in several ways. First, it can increase the attack surface of 
the system. Rather than trying to compromise a single component and propagate across all such 
components, an adversary can attack any component in the set of alternatives, looking for a 
path of least resistance to establish a foothold. Second, it can increase demands on developers, 
system administrators, maintenance staff, and users by forcing them to deal with multiple 
interfaces to equivalent components. This can result in increased system life cycle costs129 and 
increase the risk that inconsistencies will be introduced, particularly if the configuration 
alternatives for the equivalent components are organized differently. Third, diversity can be 
more apparent than real (e.g., different implementations of the same mission functionality all 
running on the same underlying operating system, applications that reuse selected software 
components). Thus, analysis of the architectural approach to using diversity is critical. For 
embedded systems, some approaches to diversity raise a variety of research challenges. Finally, 

 

127 Synthetic diversity in conjunction with randomization, a form of Unpredictability, is a form of Moving Target 
Defense (MTD). 

128 Geographic diversity can be used to support the Make resources location-versatile structural design principle. 

129 These costs have historically been acceptable in some safety-critical systems.

the effectiveness of diversity against adversaries is not an absolute, and an analysis of diversity 
strategies is needed to determine the best alternative in the context of adversary TTPs.  

Given these considerations, this design principle calls for the use of Diversity in system 
architecture and design to also take manageability into consideration. It also calls for the 
consideration of diversity in operational processes and practices, including non-cyber 
alternatives such as out-of-band measures [SP 800-53] for critical capabilities. To reduce cost 
and other impacts, this design principle is most effective when used in conjunction with the 
Focus on common critical assets strategic design principle and the Maintain redundancy and 
Layer and partition defenses structural principles. Measurements related to this design principle 
can focus on the degree of diversity, the degree of manageability, or both. 

D.5.2.6   Maintain Redundancy 

Redundancy is a well-established design principle in Resilience Engineering and Survivability 
[Sterbenz10]. Approaches to Redundancy include surplus capacity and replication (e.g., cold 
spares, hot or inline spares) and can be implemented in conjunction with backup and failover 
procedures. It can enhance the availability of critical capabilities but requires that redundant 
resources be protected.  

Because malware can propagate across homogeneous resources, Redundancy for cyber 
resiliency should be applied in conjunction with Diversity and considered at multiple levels or 
layers in a layered architecture [Sterbenz14]. However, Redundancy can increase complexity 
and present scalability challenges when used in conjunction with Diversity.   

The extent of Redundancy is established and maintained through analysis that looks for single 
points of failure and shared resources. Trends to convergence can undermine Redundancy. For 
example, an organization using Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) for its phone system cannot 
assert alternate communications paths for phone, email, and instant messaging. 

Because maintaining surplus capacity or spare components increases system life cycle costs, this 
design principle is most effective when used in conjunction with the Focus on common critical 
assets strategic principle, as well as the Plan and manage diversity and Layer and partition 
defenses structural principles. 

D.5.2.7   Make Resources Location-Versatile 

Location-versatile resources do not require a fixed location and can be relocated or 
reconstituted to maximize performance, avoid disruptions, and better avoid becoming a high-
value target for an adversary. Different approaches can be used to provide location-versatile 
resources, including virtualization, replication, distribution (of functionality or stored data), 
physical mobility, and functional relocation. Replication is a well-established approach for high-
availability systems using multiple, parallel processes, and high-availability data (sometimes 
referred to as data resilience) with database sharding130 (although this can present security 
challenges).  

 

130 A database shard is a horizontal partition of data in a database. Each individual partition is referred to as a shard or 
database shard. Each shard is held on a separate database server instance to spread the load.

Replication and distribution can be across geographic locations, hardware platforms, or (in the 
case of services) virtual machines. While replication can take the form of redundancy, it can also 
involve providing ways to reconfigure system resources to provide equivalent functionality. Data 
virtualization (i.e., data management that enables applications to retrieve and use data without 
specific knowledge of the location or format) supports distribution and reduces the likelihood 
that local (persistent and unmaintained) data stores will proliferate. Composable services enable 
the alternative reconstitution of mission capabilities, and diverse information sources can be 
used for the alternative reconstitution of mission or business data. 

Application of this principle involves the use of Dynamic Positioning, often in conjunction with 
Redundancy and/or Diversity. This principle supports the Support agility and architect for 
adaptability strategic principle and can be employed in conjunction with the Maximize 
transience and Change or disrupt the attack surface structural principles. Some approaches to 
the reconstitution of mission capabilities can conflict with the Control visibility and use 
structural principle. 

D.5.2.8   Leverage Health and Status Data 

In some architectures, many system components are security-unaware, incapable of enforcing a 
security policy (e.g., an access control policy), and therefore incapable of monitoring policy 
compliance (e.g., auditing or alerting to unauthorized access attempts). However, most system 
components provide health and status data to indicate component availability or unavailability 
for use. These may include components of CPS (particularly components in space systems) and 
in the emerging IoT. In addition, system components present health and status data to providers 
(e.g., application or service on a virtual platform in a cloud to a cloud provider) or service-
providing components (e.g., application to operating system, device to network) so that the 
components can allocate and scale resources effectively. Monitoring data, including health and 
status data, from multiple layers or types of components in the architecture can help identify 
potential problems early so they can be averted or contained. 

As architectural convergence between information technology (IT) and operational technology 
(OT) or the IoT increases [SP 1500-201], application of this structural principle will support the 
Expect adversaries to evolve strategic principle. Given the increasing number and variety of 
“smart” components in the IoT, application of this principle may be driven by the Focus on 
common critical assets principle. In addition, components can erroneously or maliciously report 
health and status data by design or due to compromise. Thus, application of this principle may 
be more effective in conjunction with the Determine ongoing trustworthiness principle. 

D.5.2.9   Maintain Situational Awareness 

For security and cyber resiliency, situational awareness encompasses awareness of system 
elements, threats, and mission dependencies on system elements.131 An awareness of system 
elements can rely on security status assessments, security monitoring, and performance 
monitoring and can be achieved in conjunction with the Leverage health and status data design 

 

131 As a foundational capability of a Security Operations Center (SOC), situational awareness provides “regular, 
repeatable repackaging and redistribution of the SOC’s knowledge of constituency assets, networks, threats, 
incidents, and vulnerabilities to constituents. This capability goes beyond cyber intel distribution, enhancing 
constituents’ understanding of the cybersecurity posture of the constituency and portions thereof, driving effective 
decision-making at all levels.” [Zimmerman14]

principle. Threat awareness involves ingesting and using threat intelligence and recognizing that 
adversaries evolve. An awareness of system elements and threats (via gathered data, correlated 
data, and processing capabilities) can be centralized or distributed and either enterprise-internal 
or cross-enterprise (e.g., via a managed security service provider).  

An awareness of mission dependencies can be determined a priori as part of system design (e.g., 
using CJA, MIA, or BIA). Alternately or additionally, mission dependencies can be identified 
during mission operations by tracking and analyzing resource use. This more dynamic approach 
supports agility, adaptability, and capabilities to Control visibility and use and Contain and 
exclude behaviors. While cyber situational awareness remains an active area of research, 
analytic capabilities are increasingly being offered, and cyber situational awareness is maturing 
through tailored applications in specific environments. 

D.5.2.10   Manage Resources (Risk-) Adaptively 

Risk-adaptive management has been developed in multiple contexts. Cybersecurity mechanisms 
include risk-adaptive access control (RAdAC) for systems—highly adaptive cybersecurity services 
(HACS) that provide such functionalities as penetration testing, incident response, cyber 
hunting, and risk and vulnerability assessment for programs—and integrated adaptive cyber 
defense (IACD) for the enterprise and beyond. Strategies for risk-adaptive management include:  

• 
Changing the frequency of planned changes (e.g., resetting encryption keys, switching 
between operating systems or platforms, or changing the configuration of internal routers)  

• 
Increasing security restrictions (e.g., requiring reauthentication periodically within a single 
session, two-factor authentication for requests from remote locations, or two-person 
control on specific actions, increasing privilege requirements based on changing criticality)  

• 
Reallocating resources (e.g., reallocating processing, communications, or storage resources 
to enable graceful degradation and the repurposing of resources)  

• 
Discarding or isolating suspected system elements (e.g., terminating a service or locking out 
a user account, diverting communications to a deception environment, or quarantining 
processing) 

Strategies for implementing this design principle can be applied in conjunction with strategies 
for implementing Control visibility and use (dynamically changing privileges), Contain and 
exclude behaviors (disabling resources and dynamic isolation), Layer defenses and partition 
resources (dynamic partitioning), Plan and manage diversity (switching from one resource to an 
equivalent resource), and Make resources location-versatile (reconstituting resources). 

To be risk-adaptive, the selection and application of a strategy should be based on situational 
awareness—that is, management decisions are based on indications of changes in adversary 
characteristics, characteristics of system elements, or patterns of operational use that change 
the risk posture of the system or the mission or business function it supports. Alternately, 
strategies can be applied unpredictably to address unknown risks. 

D.5.2.11   Maximize Transience 

Non-persistence is a cyber resiliency strategy to Reduce attack surfaces in the temporal 
dimension. Virtualization technologies, which simulate the hardware and/or software on which

other software executes [SP 800-125B], enable processes, services, and applications to be 
transient. At the network layer, technologies for network virtualization, network functions 
virtualization, software-defined networking, and just-in-time connectivity can support non-
persistence. Data virtualization provides a strategy for reducing persistent local data stores. As 
noted above, this principle is synergistic with Make resources location-versatile. Since transient 
resources can be virtually isolated, this principle can also be used in conjunction with Contain 
and exclude behaviors. 

Logical transient system elements (e.g., processes, files, connections) need to be expunged (i.e., 
removed in such a way that no data remains on the shared resources).132 If an executing process 
or service has been compromised by malicious software that changes its behavior or corrupts 
the data it offers to other system elements, expunging it—either by bringing it down or by 
moving it and deleting the prior instance—also mitigates the compromise. This can be done in 
response to suspicious behavior or be deliberately unpredictable. 

In addition, system elements can be made attritable and expendable, such as in the case of 
unmanned air systems. These physically transient system elements also need mechanisms for 
ensuring that no data is left behind.   

The instantiation of a transient resource depends on being able to Determine ongoing 
trustworthiness of the resources from which it is constructed. Support for such verification 
and/or validation can include gold copies of software and configuration data, policy data for 
network function virtualization, and data quality validation as part of data virtualization. 

D.5.2.12   Determine Ongoing Trustworthiness 

In the Command and Control and Defense Evasion phases of the cyber-attack life cycle 
[MITRE18], an adversary can modify system components (e.g., modify software, replace 
legitimate software with malware), system data (e.g., modify configuration files, fabricate 
entries in an authorization database, fabricate or delete audit data), or mission or business data 
(e.g., deleting, changing, or inserting entries in a mission or business database; replacing user-
created files with fabricated versions). These modifications enable the adversary to take actions 
in the Impact and Persistence phases of the cyber-attack life cycle. Periodic or ongoing validation 
can detect the effects of adversary activities before they become too significant or irremediable.  

A variety of Substantiated Integrity mechanisms can be used to identify suspicious changes to 
properties or behavior. Some behaviors (e.g., the frequency with which a service makes 
requests, the latency between a request to it and its response, and the size of requests or 
responses it makes) can be verified or validated by other services. Other behaviors (e.g., 
processor, memory, disk, or network) can be verified or validated by other system components 
(e.g., the operating system’s task manager). Note that making the behavior capable of being 
verified or validated can impede the use of unpredictability. 

This principle is strongly synergistic with Manage resources (risk-) adaptively. Some changes can 
trigger the use of Privilege Restriction or Analytic Monitoring mechanisms. Other changes can 
trigger quarantine via Segmentation. However, such mechanisms can add storage, processing,

and transmission overhead. Therefore, this structural principle is most effective in support of 
the Focus on common critical assets strategic principle.  

Ideally, any system element that cannot be determined to be trustworthy—initially via 
hardware and software assurance processes and subsequently via Substantiated Integrity— 
should be assumed to be compromised. However, in practice, that assumption is difficult to 
apply. This principle is consistent with the weaker assumption that some resources will be 
compromised and calls for mechanisms to detect and respond to evidence of compromise. 

Mechanisms to determine trustworthiness need to be applied in a coordinated manner, across 
architectural layers, among different types of system elements, and (if applicable) with insider 
threat controls. 

D.5.2.13   Change or Disrupt the Attack Surface 

Disruption of the attack surface can also lead an adversary to reveal its presence. A growing set 
of moving target defenses is intended to change or disrupt the attack surface of a system. 
Moving Target Defense (MTD) is an active area of research and development. MTD can be 
categorized in terms of the layer or level at which the defenses are applied (e.g., software, 
runtime environment, data, platform, and network). However, MTD can be applied at other 
layers. For example, when this design principle is used in conjunction with the Make resources 
location-versatile principle, MTD can also be applied at the physical or geographic levels. MTD is 
particularly well-suited to cloud architectures [Shetty16] where implementation is at the 
middleware level. 

MTD can also be categorized in terms of strategy: move, morph, or switch. Resources can be 
moved (e.g., execution of a service can be moved from one platform or virtual machine to 
another). This approach, which leverages the design principle of Dynamic Positioning, can be 
used in conjunction with the Make resources location-versatile principle. The terms “cyber 
maneuver” and MTD are often reserved for morphing—that is, making specific changes to the 
properties of the data, runtime environment, software, platform, or network [Okhravi13] or by 
using configuration changes in conjunction with the techniques of Diversity and Unpredictability 
or randomization [Jajodia11, Jajodia12] rather than including relocation or distribution. Data or 
software can be morphed using synthetic diversity; the behavior of system elements can be 
morphed via configuration or resource allocation changes. Morphing can also be part of a 
Deception strategy. Finally, switching can leverage diversity and distributed resources. Mission 
applications that rely on a supporting service can switch from one implementation of the service 
to another. Switching can also be used in conjunction with Deception, as when adversary 
interactions with the system are switched to a deception environment. 

This structural design principle supports the Expect adversaries to evolve strategic principle. It 
can also support the Reduce attack surfaces strategic principle. Alternately, the principle can 
support the Assume compromised resources principle. When Unpredictability is part of the way 
this principle is applied, it should be used in conjunction with the Make the effects of deception 
and unpredictability user-transparent structural principle. 

D.5.2.14   Make Deception and Unpredictability Effects User-Transparent 

Deception and unpredictability are intended to increase an adversary’s uncertainty about the 
system’s structure and behavior, what effects an adversary might be able to achieve, and what

actions cyber defenders might take in response to suspected malicious cyber-related activities. 
[Heckman15] provides a detailed discussion of deception and its role in active cyber defense. 
Deception includes obfuscation, which increases the effort needed by the adversary and can 
hide mission activities long enough for the mission to complete without adversary disruption. 
Active deception can divert adversary activities, causing the adversary to waste resources and 
reveal TTPs, intent, and targeting. 

Unpredictability can apply to structure, characteristics, or behavior. Unpredictable structure 
(e.g., dynamically changing partitions or isolating components) undermines the adversary’s 
reconnaissance efforts. Unpredictable characteristics (e.g., configurations, selection of an 
equivalent element from a diverse set) force the adversary to develop a broader range of TTPs. 
Unpredictable behavior (e.g., response latency) increases uncertainty about effects and whether 
system behavior indicates defender awareness of malicious cyber activities.  

Unpredictability and deception can be applied separately and synergistically. These two 
techniques can be highly effective against advanced adversaries. However, if implemented 
poorly, deception and unpredictability can also increase the uncertainty of end-users and 
administrators about how the system will behave. Such user and administrator confusion can 
reduce overall resilience, reliability, and security. This uncertainty can, in turn, make the 
detection of unauthorized or suspicious behavior more difficult. This design principle calls for a 
sound implementation, which makes system behaviors directed at the adversary transparent to 
end-users and system administrators. 

D.6   RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CYBER RESILIENCY CONSTRUCTS 

Sections D.1 through D.5 presented and described the cyber resiliency constructs of goals, 
objectives, techniques, approaches, and design principles. Table D-12 and Table D-13 illustrate 
that the mapping between the goals and objectives is many-to-many, as are the mappings 
between techniques (including the approaches to implementing or applying techniques) and 
objectives.

Section D.5 identifies cyber resiliency design principles. Strategic design principles support 
achieving cyber resiliency objectives as shown in Table D-14, while structural design principles 
provide guidance on how to apply cyber resiliency techniques as shown in Table D-15. Some 
techniques are required by a design principle (shown in bold text). Other techniques (not 
bolded) are typically used in conjunction with required techniques to apply the design principle 
more effectively, depending on the type of system to which the principle is applied.

D.7   APPLICATION OF CYBER RESILIENCY CONSTRUCTS 

Cyber resiliency is addressed in conjunction with the closely related concerns of system 
resilience and security. Engineering analysis for cyber resiliency emphasizes the need to meet 
system requirements and address stakeholder concerns in the face of the APT. Cyber resiliency 
focuses on the capabilities used to ensure the accomplishment of organizational missions or 
business functions, such as to continue minimum essential operations throughout an attack 
after the adversary has established a presence in the system as opposed to capabilities to 
harden the system and to keep the adversary out. The cyber resiliency goals of anticipate, 
withstand, recover, and adapt are oriented toward organizational missions or business functions 
and, thus, complement such security objectives as confidentiality, integrity, and availability that 
apply to information and information systems [SP 800-37]. Similarly, the cyber resiliency 
objectives complement the cybersecurity functions of identify, protect, detect, respond, and 
recover that an organization can use to achieve specific cybersecurity outcomes [NIST CSF].  

Due to this complementarity, cyber resiliency can also be incorporated into existing security 
activities and tasks described in the systems life cycle processes in [SP 800-160 v1]. No new 
processes are needed, nor are any new activities or tasks needed for the existing processes. 
Several phrases are integral to the statement and elaboration of the activities and tasks in the 
systems security engineering processes in [SP 800-160 v1]. These include security aspects, 
security objectives, security models, concept of security function, security criteria, security-
driven constraints, security requirements, and security relevance as applied to a variety of

terms. To overcome any potential confusion, the tailoring of statements and elaborations to 
address cyber resiliency will frequently replace the term security with security and cyber 
resiliency. Cyber resiliency offers new considerations for these existing processes, activities, and 
tasks. However, given that the language in the processes is not specific to cyber resiliency, it 
may not always be obvious how and where cyber resiliency might be injected into the 
engineering processes. The experience and expertise of systems security engineers can guide 
and inform the use of the cyber resiliency constructs described in this publication. 

 

 

SECONDARY EFFECTS OF APPLYING CYBER RESILIENCY CONSTRUCTS 

In addition to the first-order effects realized by organizations due to the application of individual 
cyber resiliency techniques (or combination of techniques) defined in this publication, there may 
also be beneficial second-order effects. For example, the “noise” (i.e., distracting information) 
created by organizations that implement the cyber resiliency techniques of Diversity, Deception, 
and Unpredictability can help improve their detection capabilities and potentially reveal the 
presence of adversaries. Second-order effects are beyond the scope of this publication.

APPENDIX E 

CONTROLS SUPPORTING CYBER RESILIENCY 
NIST SP 800-53 SECURITY CONTROLS RELATED TO CYBER RESILIENCY 

his appendix identifies controls133 in [SP 800-53] that directly support cyber resiliency. The 
methodology for determining whether a control directly supports cyber resiliency is 
outlined below. One of the challenges is that many controls can be considered to provide 
cybersecurity as well as cyber resiliency. In addition, many security practices that might, in 
principle, be considered good cybersecurity practices are not widely employed. Therefore, in 
these cases, if the control satisfies the other screening questions, the control is included in the 
listing. For each control in [SP 800-53], the following questions were used to identify controls 
that support cyber resiliency. 

• 
Is the control primarily focused on helping the system achieve a level of confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability134 in situations where threats, excluding APT, are considered? If so, 
the control supports conventional information security. The control may provide functional, 
architectural, governance, or procedural capabilities that establish a necessary foundation 
for cyber resiliency. However, the control does not support cyber resiliency as a primary 
consideration. 

• 
Is the control primarily focused on ensuring the continuity of operations against threats of 
natural disasters, infrastructure failures, or cascading failures in which software or human 
errors are implicated? If so, the control supports organizational or operational resilience in 
the face of conventional threats. The control may provide functional, architectural, 
governance, or procedural capabilities that establish a necessary foundation for cyber 
resiliency. However, it does not support cyber resiliency, per se. 

• 
Does the control map to one or more of the 14 cyber resiliency techniques? The techniques 
characterize ways to achieve one or more cyber resiliency objectives. For some controls, 
mapping to a technique or an approach is trivial. For example, the control SI-14 (Non-
Persistence) maps to the cyber resiliency technique of Non-Persistence as the control and 
cyber resiliency technique share the same name and achieve the same outcome. In other 
instances, the mapping is relatively straightforward, although not quite as trivial. For 
example, SC-29 (Heterogeneity) is about the use of diverse information resources, so it 
supports the cyber resiliency Diversity technique. In other instances, the mapping is not as 
straightforward, and the guidance listed below should be employed to help identify cyber 
resiliency controls. 

• 
Does the control map to one of the cyber resiliency approaches that support the 14 cyber 
resiliency techniques? For example, SC-30(4) (Concealment and Misdirection | Misleading 
Information) maps to the Disinformation approach of the Deception technique. Since the 
approaches provide a finer granularity than the techniques, this question provides a more 
detailed analysis of the controls, and a control that maps to an approach is likely to be a 
resiliency control. 

 

133 For the remainder of this appendix, the term control includes both base controls (e.g., AC-6) and control 
enhancements (e.g., AC-6(1)). 

134 The control baselines in [SP 800-53B] are defined for levels of concern for confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
with respect to threats other than the advanced persistent threat.

Many of the controls in [SP 800-53] address other important types of safeguards that are not 
necessarily related to cyber resiliency. Controls of this type are generally not included in the set 
of controls that support cyber resiliency. These controls include: 

• 
Policy controls (the -1 controls) 

The -1 controls (the policy and procedure controls) do not directly map to cyber resiliency 
techniques or approaches. Only a policy control that is specifically written to address the 
APT should be identified as a cyber resiliency control. 

• 
Documentation controls 

Like the policy controls, documentation controls generally do not satisfy the conditions 
listed above. A documentation control would have to be narrowly focused (e.g., document 
how to respond to the presence of the advanced persistent threat) for it to be considered a 
cyber resiliency control.  

• 
Environmental controls (e.g., A/C, heating, found in PE family) 

Environmental controls do not satisfy the conditions listed above unless they are narrowly 
focused (e.g., controls that address intentional power surges). 

• 
Personnel security controls 

Personnel security controls do not satisfy the conditions listed above.   

• 
Compliance controls (e.g., those checking to ensure that all patches are up to date) 

Cyber resiliency focuses primarily on evolving and adapting rather than on compliance. 
Thus, unless a control is explicitly focused on ensuring that some specific (already 
established) cyber resiliency capability is implemented correctly and operating as intended, 
compliance controls are generally not considered part of cyber resiliency. 

• 
Vulnerability assessment controls  
While adversaries take advantage of vulnerabilities, identifying such vulnerabilities is not the 
focus of cyber resiliency. 

Some control families are more likely to support cyber resiliency than others. The Contingency 
Planning (CP), Incident Response (IR), System and Communications Protection (SC), and System 
and Information Integrity (SI) families have a high percentage of controls that are cyber 
resiliency oriented. However, controls that support cyber resiliency are not confined to these 
families nor are all controls in these families automatically controls supporting cyber resiliency.  

After the above criteria are applied, there may still be some ambiguity for some controls as to 
whether or not they are cyber resiliency in their focus. This is due in part to the overlap between 
aspects of cybersecurity and cyber resiliency. Delineation between the two is not easy to 
discern. To illustrate the distinction, it is useful to reference first principles. 

Cyber resiliency is essentially about ensuring continued mission operations despite the fact that 
an adversary has established a foothold in the organization’s systems and cyber infrastructure. 

• 
Controls that are largely focused on keeping the adversary out of systems and infrastructure 
are generally not resiliency controls. For example, identification and authentication controls 
such as IA-4 (Identifier Management) are generally not focused on combating an adversary 
after they have achieved a foothold in an organizational system. Similarly, physical access

controls (e.g., PE-2, PE-4) are generally considered basic information security measures, not 
cyber resiliency measures. 

• 
One area where there is likely to be some confusion is between Auditing and Analytic 
Monitoring. Controls that are focused on the correlation of collected information are more 
likely to be Analytic Monitoring-focused. Controls that are focused on storage capacity for 
audit trails, what information should be captured in an audit trail, or retention of the audit 
trail are more likely to fall into the Audit domain. 

• 
In many instances, cyber resiliency capabilities are reflected in control enhancements 
instead of base controls. In those situations, [SP 800-53] requires that a parent control be 
selected if one or more of its control enhancements are selected. This means that for any 
cyber resiliency control enhancement selected, the associated base control is also selected 
and included in the security plan for the system.  

Table E-1 identifies the controls and control enhancements in [SP 800-53] that support cyber 
resiliency using the criteria outlined above. For each of the selected cyber resiliency controls or 
control enhancements, the table specifies the corresponding cyber resiliency technique and 
approach. In many instances, more than one cyber resiliency technique or approach is provided 
because many of the controls and control enhancements support more than one technique or 
approach. If there are multiple corresponding cyber resiliency techniques, they are listed in a 
prioritized order where the technique with the strongest linkage is listed first.

 ADVERSARY-ORIENTED ANALYSIS 
APPROACHES FOR TAKING ADVERSARIAL ACTIVITIES INTO CONSIDERATION 

his appendix supports an adversary-oriented analysis of a system and applications of cyber 
resiliency, as discussed in Section 3.1.7, Section 3.2.3.2, and Section 3.2.4.3. Section F.1 
provides a vocabulary to describe the current or potential effects that a set of mitigations 
(i.e., risk-reducing actions or decisions, such as the application of cyber resiliency design 
principles, techniques, implementation approaches, requirements, controls, technologies, or 
solutions) could have on threat events, classes of threat events, or threat scenarios.135 Each 
intended effect is characterized in terms of its potential impact on risk and the expected 
changes in adversary behavior. Section F.2 presents the results of an analysis of the potential 
effects of mitigations that apply cyber resiliency approaches and controls on adversary TTPs 
using ATT&CK™ for Enterprise. 

F.1   POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON THREAT EVENTS 

Cyber resiliency solutions are relevant only if they have some effect on risk, specifically by 
reducing the likelihood of the occurrence of threat events,136 the ability of threat events to 
cause harm, and the extent of that harm.137 The types of analysis of system architectures, 
designs, implementations, and operations that are indicated for cyber resiliency can include 
consideration of what effects alternatives could have on the threat events that are part of threat 
scenarios of concern to stakeholders. 

From the perspective of protecting a system against adversarial threats, five high-level, desired 
effects on the adversary can be identified: redirect, preclude, impede, limit, and expose. These 
effects are useful for discussion but are often too general to facilitate the definition of specific 
measures of effectiveness. Therefore, more specific classes of effects are defined: 

• 
Deter, divert, and deceive in support of redirect 

• 
Expunge, preempt, and negate in support of preclude  

• 
Contain, degrade, delay, and exert in support of impede 

• 
Shorten and reduce in support of limit 

• 
Detect, reveal, and scrutinize in support of expose 

 

135 While this appendix focuses on potential effects on adversary actions, most of the vocabulary applies to threat 
events caused by the full range of possible threat sources identified in [SP 800-30]. 

136 The term threat event refers to an event or situation that has the potential to cause undesirable consequences or 
impacts. Threat events can be caused by either adversarial or non-adversarial threat sources. However, the emphasis 
in this section is on the effect on adversarial threats and, specifically, on the APT for which threat events can be 
identified with adversary activities.  

137 While many risk models are potentially valid and useful, three elements (or risk factors) are common across most 
models: (1) the likelihood of occurrence (i.e., the likelihood that a threat event or a threat scenario consisting of a set 
of interdependent events will occur or be initiated by an adversary), (2) the likelihood of impact (i.e., the likelihood 
that a threat event or scenario will result in an impact given vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and predisposing conditions), 
and (3) the level of the impact [SP 800-30]. In general use, “mitigation” relates to impact reduction. However, when 
applied to a threat event, mitigation can relate to the reduction of any of these risk factors.

These effects are tactical (i.e., local to a specific threat event or scenario), although it is possible 
that their repeated achievement could have strategic effects as well. All effects except deter, 
deceive, and exert apply to non-adversarial and adversarial threat events; deter, deceive, and 
exert are applicable only to adversarial threat events. 

Table F-1 defines the effects and provides informal notes in italics. It also indicates how each 
effect could reduce risk and illustrates how the use of certain approaches to implementing cyber 
resiliency techniques for protection against attack could have the identified effect. The term 
defender refers to the organization or organizational personnel responsible for providing or 
applying protections. It should be noted that likelihoods and impact can be reduced, but risk 
cannot be eliminated. Thus, no effect can be assumed to be complete, even those with names 
that suggest completeness, such as negate, detect, or expunge. Table F-2 shows the potential 
effects of cyber resiliency techniques on risk factors. 

TABLE F-1:  EFFECTS OF CYBER RESILIENCY TECHNIQUES ON ADVERSARIAL THREAT EVENTS 

INTENDED EFFECT 
IMPACT ON RISK 
EXPECTED RESULTS 

REDIRECT (includes deter, 
divert, and deceive) 

Direct the threat event away 
from defender-chosen 
resources. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of occurrence, and (to 
a lesser extent) reduce 
the likelihood of 
impact. 

• The adversary’s efforts cease. 
• The adversary actions are mistargeted or misinformed. 

DETER 

Discourage the adversary 
from taking an action by 
instilling fear (e.g., of 
attribution or retribution) or 
doubt that the action would 
achieve intended effects 
(e.g., that targets exist). 

This effect is relevant only to 
adversarial threat events 
and involves influencing the 
adversary’s decision-making 
process. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of occurrence. 

• The adversary ceases or suspends activities. 

Example: The defender uses disinformation to make it 
appear that the organization is better able to detect 
attacks than it is, and that it is willing to launch major 
counter-strikes. Therefore, the adversary chooses to not 
launch an attack due to fear of detection and reprisal. 

DIVERT 

Direct the threat event 
toward or away from 
defender-chosen resources. 

The event affects resources 
that the defender does not 
care about or for which the 
defender can manage 
consequences. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of occurrence. 

• The adversary refocuses activities on defender-chosen 

resources. 

• The adversary directs activities toward targets beyond 

the defender’s purview (e.g., other organizations). 

• The adversary does not affect resources that the 

defender has not selected to be targets.  

Example: The defender maintains an Internet-visible 
enclave with which untrusted external entities can 
interact and a private enclave accessible only via a VPN 
for trusted suppliers, partners, or customers (predefined 
segmentation).  

Example: The defender uses non-persistent information 
and obfuscation to hide critical resources combined with 
functional relocation of cyber resources and 
disinformation to lure the adversary toward a sandboxed

enclave where adversary actions cannot harm critical 
resources. 

DECEIVE 

Lead the adversary to 
believe false information 
about individuals, systems, 
missions, organizations, 
defender capabilities, or 
TTPs. 

This effect is relevant only to 
adversarial threat events 
and involves influencing the 
adversary’s actions. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of occurrence, and/or 
reduce the likelihood 
of impact. 

• The adversary’s efforts are wasted as the assumptions 

on which the adversary bases attacks are false. 

• The adversary takes actions based on false 

information, thus revealing that they have obtained 
that information.  

Example: The defender strategically places false 
information (disinformation) about the cybersecurity 
investments that it plans to make. As a result, the 
adversary’s malware development is wasted by being 
focused on countering non-existent cybersecurity 
protections. 

Example: The defender uses selectively planted false 
information (disinformation) and honeynets 
(misdirection) to cause an adversary to focus its malware 
on virtual sandboxes while simultaneously employing 
obfuscation to hide the actual resources. 

PRECLUDE (includes 
expunge, preempt, and 
negate) 

Ensure that the threat event 
does not have an impact. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of occurrence, and/or 
reduce the likelihood 
of impact. 

• The adversary’s efforts or resources cannot be applied 

or are wasted. 

EXPUNGE 

Remove resources that are 
known to be or suspected of 
being unsafe, incorrect, or 
corrupted.  

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact of 
subsequent events in 
the same threat 
scenario. 

• A malfunctioning, misbehaving, or suspect resource is 

restored to normal operation. 

• The adversary loses a capability for some period, as 

adversary-directed threat mechanisms (e.g., malicious 
code) are removed. 

• Adversary-controlled resources are so badly damaged 

that they cannot perform any function or be restored 
to a usable condition without being entirely rebuilt. 

Example: The defender uses virtualization to refresh 
critical software (non-persistent services) from a known 
good copy at random intervals (temporal 
unpredictability). As a result, malware that was 
implanted in the software is deleted. 

PREEMPT 

Forestall or avoid conditions 
under which the threat 
event could occur. 

The threat event cannot 
have any consequences 
because it cannot actually 
occur. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of occurrence. 

• The adversary’s resources cannot be applied, or the 

adversary cannot perform activities (e.g., because 
resources the adversary requires are destroyed or 
made inaccessible). 

Example: An unneeded network connection is disabled 
(non-persistent connectivity) so that an attack via that 
interface cannot be made. 

Example: A resource is repositioned (asset mobility) so 
that it cannot be affected by a threat event in its new 
location. 

NEGATE 

Create conditions under 
which the threat event 
cannot be expected to result 
in an impact. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact. 

• The adversary can launch an attack, but it will not even 

partially succeed. The adversary’s efforts are wasted as 
the assumptions on which the adversary based its 
attack are no longer valid, and as a result, the intended 
effects cannot be achieved.

The threat event may 
produce consequences, but 
those consequences cannot 
produce an impact. 

Example: Subtle variations in critical software are 
implemented (synthetic diversity) and prevent the 
adversary’s malware from compromising the targeted 
software. 

IMPEDE (includes contain, 
degrade, delay, and exert) 

Make it more difficult for 
the threat event to cause 
adverse impacts or 
consequences. 

For adversarial threats, this 
involves decreasing the 
adversary’s return on 
investment (ROI) for the 
threat event. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact and reduce 
the level of impact. 

• Adversary activities are restricted in scope, fail to 

achieve full effect, do not take place in accordance 
with the adversary timeline, or require greater 
resources than the adversary had planned. 

CONTAIN 

Restrict the effects of the 
threat event to a limited set 
of resources. 

The consequences of the 
threat event are less 
extensive than they might 
otherwise be. 

Reduce the level of 
impact. 

• The adversary can affect fewer resources than 

planned. The value of the activity to the adversary, in 
terms of achieving the adversary’s goals, is reduced. 

Example: The defender organization makes changes to a 
combination of internal firewalls and logically separated 
networks (dynamic segmentation and isolation) to 
isolate enclaves in response to the detection of malware, 
limiting the effects of the malware to initially infected 
enclaves. 

DEGRADE 

Decrease the expected 
consequences of the threat 
event.  

Because the consequences of 
the threat event are less 
severe than they would be 
without the mitigation, they 
could fail to produce an 
impact, or their impact could 
be lessened. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact, and/or 
reduce the level of 
impact. 

• Not all of the resources targeted by the adversary are 

affected, or the targeted resources are affected to a 
lesser degree than the adversary sought.  

Example: The defender uses multiple browsers and 
operating systems (architectural diversity) on both end-
user systems and some critical servers. The result is that 
malware targeted at specific software can only 
compromise a subset of the targeted systems; a 
sufficient number continue to operate to complete the 
mission or business function. 

DELAY 

Increase the amount of time 
needed for the threat event 
to result in adverse impacts. 

Because the consequences of 
the threat event occur later 
than they would without the 
mitigation, they could fail to 
produce an impact, or their 
impact could be lessened. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact, and/or 
reduce the level of 
impact. 

• The adversary achieves the intended effects but not 

within the intended period. 

Example: The protection measures (e.g., access controls, 
encryption) allocated to resources increase in number 
and strength based on resource criticality (calibrated 
defense-in-depth). The frequency of authentication 
challenges varies randomly (temporal unpredictability) 
and more often for more critical resources. The result is 
that it takes the attacker more time to successfully 
compromise the targeted resources. 

EXERT
Increase the level of effort 
or resources needed for an 
adversary to achieve a given 
result. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact.  

• The adversary gives up planned or partially completed 

activities in response to finding that additional effort 
or resources are needed. 

• The adversary achieves the intended effects in their 

desired time frame but only by applying more

EXPECTED RESULTS 

This effect is relevant only to

adversary’s costs. 

resources. Thus, the adversary’s return on investment 
(ROI) is decreased. 

• The adversary reveals TTPs they had planned to 

reserve for future use. 

Example: The defender enhances the defenses of 
moderate-criticality components with additional 
mitigations (calibrated defense-in-depth). To overcome 
these, the adversary must tailor and deploy TTPs that 
they were planning to reserve for use against higher 
value defender targets. 

Example: The defender adds a large amount of valid but 
useless information to a data store (obfuscation), 
requiring the adversary to exfiltrate and analyze more 
data before taking further actions. 

LIMIT (includes shorten and 
reduce) 

Restrict the impacts of a 
realized threat event by 
limiting the damage or 
effects it causes in terms of 
time, system resources, 
and/or mission or business 
impacts. 

Reduce the level of 
impact, and reduce 
the likelihood of 
impact of subsequent 
events in the same 
threat scenario. 

• The adversary’s effectiveness is restricted. 

 

SHORTEN 

Limit the duration of 
adverse consequences of a 
threat event. 

Because the consequences of 
the threat event do not 
persist as long as they would 
without the mitigation, they 
could fail to produce an 
impact, or their impact could 
be lessened. 

Reduce the level of 
impact. 

• The time period during which the adversary’s activities 

affect defender resources is limited. 

Example: The defender employs a diverse set of 
suppliers (supply chain diversity) for time-critical 
components. As a result, when an adversary’s attack on 
one supplier causes it to shut down, the defender can 
increase its use of the other suppliers, thus shortening 
the time during which it is without the critical 
components. 

REDUCE 

Decrease the degree of 
damage from a threat event. 
The degree of damage can 
have two dimensions: 
breadth (i.e., number of 
affected resources) and 
depth (i.e., level of harm to 
a given resource). 

A decrease in the degree of 
damage lessens the impact. 

Reduce the level of 
impact. 

• The level of damage to organizational missions or 

business operations from adversary activities is 
reduced due to partial restoration or reconstitution of 
all affected resources. 

Example: Resources determined to be corrupted or 
suspect (integrity checks, behavior validation) are 
restored from older, uncorrupted resources (protected 
backup and restore) with reduced functionality. 

• The level of damage to organizational missions or 

business operations from adversary activities is 
reduced due to full restoration or reconstitution of 
some of the affected resources. 

Example: The organization removes one of three 
compromised resources and provides a new resource 
(replacement, specialization) for the same or equivalent 
mission or business functionality.

INTENDED EFFECT 
IMPACT ON RISK 
EXPECTED RESULTS 

EXPOSE (includes detect, 
scrutinize, and reveal) 
Reduce risk due to 
ignorance of threat events 
and possible replicated or 
similar threat events in the 
same or similar 
environments.  

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact. 

• The adversary loses the advantage of stealth as 

defenders are better prepared by developing and 
sharing threat intelligence. 

DETECT  

Identify a threat event or its 
effects by discovering or 
discerning the fact that the 
event is occurring, has 
occurred, or (based on 
indicators, warnings, and 
precursor activities) is about 
to occur. 

Detection informs corrective 
actions. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact, and reduce 
the level of impact 
(depending on 
responses). 

• The adversary’s activities become susceptible to 

defensive responses. 

Example: The defender continually moves its sensors 
(functional relocation of sensors), often at random times 
(temporal unpredictability), to common points of egress 
from the organization. They combine this with the use of 
beacon traps (tainting). The result is that the defender 
can quickly detect efforts by the adversary to exfiltrate 
sensitive information. 

SCRUTINIZE 

Analyze threat events and 
artifacts associated with 
threat events to develop 
indicators, determine 
sources of events, assess 
damage, and identify 
patterns of exploiting 
vulnerabilities, predisposing 
conditions, and weaknesses. 

Scrutiny informs more 
effective detection and risk 
response. 

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact. 

• The adversary loses the advantages of uncertainty, 

confusion, and doubt. 

• The defender has a better understanding the 

adversary, based on an analysis of the adversary’s 
activities, including the artifacts (e.g., malicious code) 
and effects associated with those activities and the 
correlation of activity-specific observations with other 
activities (as feasible), and, thus, can recognize 
adversary TTPs. 

Example: The defender deploys honeynets 
(misdirection), inviting attacks by the adversary and 
allowing the adversary to apply its TTPs in a safe 
environment. The defender then analyzes (forensic and 
behavioral analysis) the malware captured in the 
honeynet to determine the nature of the attacker’s TTPs, 
allowing it to develop appropriate defenses. 

REVEAL 

Share information about risk 
factors and the relative 
effectiveness of remediation 
approaches with partners, 
stakeholder community, or 
the general public. 

Threat information sharing 
supports common, joint, or 
coordinated risk responses. 
Information about threat 
events can be shared 
broadly or with a limited set 
of threat intelligence 
information-sharing 
partners.  

Reduce the likelihood 
of impact, particularly 
in the future. 

• The adversary loses the advantage of surprise and 

plausible deniability. 

• The adversary’s ability to compromise one 

organization’s systems to attack another organization 
is impaired as awareness of adversary characteristics 
and behavior across the stakeholder community (e.g., 
across all computer security incident response teams 
that support a given sector that might be expected to 
be attacked by the same actor or actors) is increased. 

Example: The defender participates in threat 
information sharing and uses dynamically updated threat 
intelligence data feeds (dynamic threat awareness) to 
inform actions (adaptive management).

F.2   ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CYBER RESILIENCY 

The focus of cyber resiliency is on mitigating attacks on systems and organizations from the APT. 
It is important to understand what effects these mitigations have on adversaries. Mapping the 
current or potential effects of mitigations to a threat taxonomy provides a structured way to 
facilitate this understanding. This appendix presents the results of such analysis using ATT&CK  
for Enterprise [MITRE18]. 

ATT&CK provides a knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and associated information 
based on curated data sets of real-world observations. ATT&CK reflects the phases of an 
adversary’s attack life cycle and the platforms (e.g., Windows) adversaries are known to target, 
providing a taxonomy of adversarial TTPs with a focus on those used by external adversaries 
executing cyber-attacks against networked systems. For purposes of this analysis, the following 
components of ATT&CK are relevant:  

• 
Tactics, denoting short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack 

• 
Techniques, describing the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals, and given 
identifiers of the form T#### (where #### represents a numeric identifier) 

• 
Detection methods for each technique, captured as descriptive text in ATT&CK™

• 
Mitigations, describing technologies and practices which have been observed (in one or 
more of the curated data sets) to mitigate the techniques with which they are 
associated, and given identifiers of the form M#### (where #### represents a numeric 
identifier) 

ATT&CK also defines sub-techniques, describing more specific means by which adversaries 
achieve tactical goals at a lower level than techniques (typically related to specific technologies 
or platforms), and associates mitigations and detection methods with sub-techniques. ATT&CK 
provides information about APT groups and about malware used by one or more APT actors. 
However, the analysis presented below does not consider sub-techniques, groups, malware, or 
other information included in ATT&CK™. 

F.2.1.  Assumptions and Caveats 

The analysis is restricted to mitigations that apply one or more cyber resiliency approaches and 
use one or more cyber resiliency controls,138 as identified in Table E-1 and in the ATT&CK 
knowledge base from curated datasets of real-world data and assigned identifiers of the form 
M10##. The analysis also uses candidate mitigations139 defined by engineering analysis but not 
part of the ATT&CK knowledge base. Candidate mitigations are discussed in Section F.2.4, 
presented in Tables F-17 through F-19, and assigned identifiers of the form CM11##, CM13##, 
and CM20##. The analysis excludes from consideration those ATT&CK mitigations that do not 
apply a cyber resiliency approach but instead use conventional security methods to mitigate the 
ATT&CK technique. While such security methods can be effective, they are out of scope for this 
publication. The analysis is restricted to ATT&CK techniques and does not include ATT&CK sub-
techniques. Sub-techniques generally focus on specific platforms or technologies (e.g., SaaS, 
Windows), and controls are not platform- or technology-specific. 

The analysis considers only the direct effects that a particular control could have when 
implemented and used as described in the context of the mitigation or candidate mitigation. 
Indirect effects are not identified. Therefore, this analysis does not consider related controls 
(i.e., base controls for identified cyber resiliency control enhancements, controls identified as 
related for cyber resiliency controls). Similarly, this analysis does not map controls that influence 
the system architecture (e.g., control enhancements to SA-8, Security and Privacy Engineering 
Principles).  

Some cyber resiliency controls do not appear in Tables F-3 through F-16. There are two reasons 
for a control not being referenced in the ATT&CK mapping. First, a control could be intended to 
address threats not represented in ATT&CK for Enterprise (e.g., insider threats, threats against 
ICS, threats from maintenance staff, attacks on wireless communications). Second, a control 
could have no effect on any specific adversary TTP, either directly or by intensifying the 
effectiveness of an existing mitigation or candidate mitigation. This is particularly the case for 
design principles and requirements on system development. The effects of these controls are 
inherently indirect.  

 

138 For brevity, the term control will be used to include control enhancements (e.g., AC-6(1)) as well as base controls 
(e.g., AC-6). 

139 A candidate mitigation is a mitigation, defined in the context of ATT&CK™, that has not been derived from a 
curated data set. It is designated as a “candidate” to differentiate it from the mitigations in the ATT&CK knowledge 
base.

Note that this analysis simply identifies the potential effects of the implementation approaches. 
It does not and cannot assess how strongly any identified effect will be experienced by an APT 
actor.140 A more detailed analysis would require knowledge of the type of system (including the 
system architecture and the types of technologies used) and the organization to which the 
requirements are to be applied. In addition, more detailed analysis could go beyond mapping to 
adversary objectives and map to adversary actions or individual adversary TTPs (e.g., as defined 
by the ATT&CK framework). Finally, some effects are beyond what can be designed and 
implemented in a technical system or the system’s supporting processes and practices. For 
example, the detection of adversary Resource Development actions requires cyber and other 
types of intelligence gathering and analyses, which are beyond the scope of cyber resiliency. 
Similarly, the Reveal effect involves the use of cyber threat intelligence by other organizations. 

F.2.2   Potential Uses of Analysis 

By observing which effects a given approach could potentially have on a threat event, the 
systems engineer can determine which approaches (and corresponding controls) could 
maximize the system’s chances of mitigating the adversary’s actions. Thus, using the tables of 
this appendix may reveal to a systems engineer that the approaches (and correspondingly, the 
controls) that they are planning to invest in are largely focused on detecting an adversary, 
containing an adversary’s assault, shortening the duration of a successful adversary attack, and 
reducing the damage from such an attack. Correspondingly, such an assessment would reveal to 
the system engineer that the organization’s planned investments may be lacking in controls that 
have other effects, such as diverting or deceiving the adversary or preempting or negating the 
adversary’s attempted attack. Such information can help the engineer and other stakeholders 
reconsider their cyber security investments so that they might be more balanced.  

The tables also reveal which approaches and correspondingly, which controls have multiple 
potential effects on the adversary and which have only a few potential effects on the adversary. 
Such information might help inform investment decisions by guiding stakeholders to controls 
that have multiple effects, including those in which the organization has not previously invested. 

A control or a cyber resiliency approach per se will not have an effect on an adversary TTP—
effects are achieved by threat-aware implementation and use of controls and approaches. More 
specifically, the descriptions of mitigations and candidate mitigations provide guidance on how 
to tailor statements of controls (via selections and assignments) to achieve the intended effects. 
Note that if a control enhancement is tailored, its base control will typically also need to be 
tailored. The descriptions of the candidate mitigations in Section F.2.4 and [Bodeau21] indicate 
how the implementation and use of controls could have the identified effects. The descriptions 
of candidate mitigations, which are at a higher level of abstraction than cyber resiliency controls 
and approaches and often involve multiple controls and approaches, could also serve as the 
starting points for system requirements. 

Note that not all adversary tactics are affected by all approaches. Some tactics are affected only 
by one or two approaches. This is generally the case for adversary tactics in the early stages 
(e.g., Reconnaissance, Resource Development), which largely involve adversary actions done 
prior to accessing a defender’s system. 

 

140 Any true measure of effectiveness will need to be defined and evaluated in a situated manner (i.e., by identifying 
assumptions about the architectural, technical, operational, and threat environments, as discussed in Section 3.2.1).

141 The purpose of defining candidate mitigations is to ensure that the analysis uses a consistent method to identify 
which cyber resiliency approaches and controls could affect a given ATT&CK technique and to capture the reasoning 
about how cyber resiliency effects could be achieved. In contrast to the mitigations of ATT&CK, which are derived 
from operational experience and curated data sets, candidate mitigations are based on engineering analysis. 

142 [SP 800-53] requires that a parent control be selected if one or more of its control enhancements are selected. This 
means that for any cyber resiliency control enhancement selected, the associated base control is also selected and 
included in the security plan for the system.

143 The Reveal effect is identified only for some uses of CM1101. Reveal can be an effect if the organization uses the 
PM-16 control—which is cited by M1019, CM2012, and CM1301—to share threat information that it develops with 
other organizations rather than simply being a consumer of threat information developed by other organizations.

F.2.4   Candidate Mitigations 

Neither a cyber resiliency implementation approach nor a security control per se has a potential 
effect on an adversary TTP or other threat event. Rather, it is the way the cyber resiliency 
approaches and controls are implemented and used that can produce an effect. In the Potential 
Effects on Threat Events (PETE) analysis for ATT&CK™, descriptions of potential uses of cyber 
resiliency implementation approaches and controls are captured via ATT&CK mitigations or

candidate mitigations. A candidate mitigation is defined in the context of ATT&CK and given an 
identifier in the form CM####, which is derived from engineering analysis rather than from a 
curated data set. It is designated as a “candidate” to differentiate it from the mitigations in the 
ATT&CK knowledge base. A mitigation or candidate mitigation is given an identifier and a name 
(a short phrase). These identifiers and names appear in the mapping tables in Section F.2.3. 

Tables F-17 through F-19 define the candidate mitigations.147 The structure of a candidate 
mitigation is similar to that of mitigations described in the ATT&CK knowledge base (i.e., an 
identifier, a name, a brief general description). In addition, the cyber resiliency approaches and 
controls that implement the mitigation are identified. The description tailored to individual 
techniques serves to improve consistency in the analysis of how defender actions or decisions 
could affect adversary activities as described in ATT&CK™. However, because the candidate 
mitigations are not part of the ATT&CK knowledge base, the identification and numbering 
scheme is different—that is, candidate mitigation identifiers begin with “CM.” 

Table F-17 identifies candidate mitigations that are intended to have an effect other than 
Expose, with identifiers of the form CM11##. Table F-18 identifies candidate mitigations that are 
solely intended to have the Expose effect, with identifiers of the form CM20##. These candidate 
mitigations are derived from the Detection descriptions in ATT&CK. Many of the Detection 
mitigations use the same cyber resiliency controls, particularly IR-4(13) and SI-4(2). However, as 
indicated by the different names of the candidate mitigations, the implementation of those 
controls and the use of as-implemented capabilities can vary significantly. Table F-19 identifies 
candidate mitigations that could increase the effectiveness of other candidate mitigations or 
ATT&CK mitigations, with identifiers of the form CM13##.148 Since these candidate mitigations 
have no direct effect on threat events, they are not included in the PETE analysis for ATT&CK™. 
For each candidate mitigation, one or more cyber resiliency controls (i.e., base controls or 
control enhancements as listed in Table E-1) are identified, and the cyber resiliency approaches 
associated with the identified set of controls are also identified. A high-level description of the 
candidate mitigation is also given.  

The controls (and associated cyber resiliency approaches) used by a candidate mitigation to 
mitigate different threat events can vary. Thus, for a given threat event, only a subset of the 
controls identified in Tables F-17 through F-19 could be used. The effects of a mitigation or 
candidate mitigation on different threat events can also vary, depending on the details of the 
threat events and how the mitigation or candidate mitigation is used.149 The list of candidate 
mitigations in Tables F-17, F-18, and F-19 is not exhaustive. Other candidate mitigations that 
employ conventional security measures (not cyber resiliency mitigations) to address ATT&CK 
techniques could be identified through engineering analysis. 

 
 

 

147 See [Bodeau21] for definitions of ATT&CK mitigations.  

148 Gaps in numbering of candidate mitigations are artifacts of the analysis process and do not indicate that additional 
candidate mitigations are defined elsewhere.

OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES150 
AN ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF CYBER RESILIENCY ON ADVERSARY TTPs 

his appendix provides an analysis of the potential effects of cyber resiliency on operational 
technologies—and in particular, on the adversary TTPs identified in the ATT&CK™ for 
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) knowledge base.151 This analysis is similar to the analysis 
presented in Appendix F (ATT&CK for Enterprise).152 Section G.1 describes the analysis approach 
based on the general methodology and results of analysis of ATT&CK for Enterprise. Section G.2 
presents the results of the analysis and the candidate mitigations used in the analysis. 

G.1   ANALYSIS APPROACH 

ATT&CK for ICS closely parallels ATT&CK for Enterprise but differs in several ways. ATT&CK for 
ICS provides its own numbering scheme for Tactics, Techniques, and Mitigations. About half of 
the mitigations in ATT&CK for ICS (i.e., mitigations with identifiers of the form M09##) 
correspond to mitigations in ATT&CK for Enterprise (i.e., mitigations with identifiers of the form 
M10##). The remainder of the mitigations (i.e., mitigations with identifiers of the form M08##) 
are unique to ATT&CK for ICS. Many mitigations in ATT&CK for ICS have associated identified 
controls from one or more of [SP 800-53], [IEC 62443-3-3], and [IEC 62443-4-2]. Many of the 
techniques in ATT&CK for ICS share names with techniques in ATT&CK for Enterprise. However, 
the descriptions and identified mitigations are different. Therefore, the ATT&CK for ICS 
mappings are presented as separate tables. 

G.1.1   Assumptions and Caveats 

Industrial control systems can have significant architectural variations, depending on how the 
systems are used. To make the identification of techniques generally useful, ATT&CK for ICS 
makes as few architectural assumptions as possible. These assumptions include: 

• 
The architecture includes an information technology (IT) network, a separate operational 
technology (OT) network, and a few systems (e.g., Data Historian, Engineering Workstation) 
or devices (e.g., firewalls) that bridge the IT and OT networks. 

• 
The IT network has an interface to the Internet. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the IT 
network and the Internet is standard practice. 

• 
Examples of devices or systems on the OT network include:  

- 
Base Process Control Systems, including input/output (I/O) servers; field controllers, 
remote terminal units (RTUs), programmable line controllers (PLCs), and intelligent 

 

150  The analysis in this appendix focuses only on Industrial Control Systems, a type of operational technology. 
However, the analysis can be applied to other types of operational technologies on a case-by-case basis. 

151 Operational technology (OT) encompasses a broad range of programmable systems or devices that interact with 
the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems/devices 
detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples 
include industrial control systems, building management systems, transportation systems, physical access control 
systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems. 

152 See Appendix F for definitions and a description of the general methodology.

electronic devices (IEDs); operator interfaces and monitoring; data collection (real-time 
and historical) and monitoring; and alarm systems 

- 
Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) and protection systems 

- 
Engineering and maintenance systems 

In general, the systems or devices on the OT network have limited storage capacity, and 
capabilities for monitoring and self-analysis are limited to providing basic health and status 
data. The OT network may also have limited bandwidth or may be functionally segmented 
into higher-bandwidth subnets within remote facilities with lower-bandwidth connectivity 
between facilities. Human-machine interfaces (HMIs) can be part of these types of devices 
or systems. While security products and training for the ICS domain are becoming more 
sophisticated, it should generally not be assumed that a well-resourced cadre of cyber 
defenders can operate on the OT network.  

In addition to the assumptions described above, there are several caveats to the analysis 
presented in this appendix that must be understood for the results to be used correctly. These 
caveats include: 

• 
Mappings based on analysis rather than observation. The mappings of cyber resiliency 
controls and approaches to ATT&CK techniques presented in this document are based on 
engineering analysis rather than on operational experience and curated data sets. The 
candidate mitigations defined in Table G-13 are not part of the ATT&CK knowledge base. 
Rather, they are intended to facilitate understanding of how cyber resiliency approaches 
and controls can be used to mitigate different techniques. 

• 
Assumed use of controls. The inclusion of a control in a system’s requirements does not in 
itself guarantee any effect on adversary activities. The effects on threat events (whether 
adversarial or not) depend on (1) how the controls are specified (e.g., using assignment or 
selection operations), (2) how the control is implemented, and (3) how the implementation 
is used. The intended use of the control is indicated in the technique-specific description of 
the mitigation or candidate mitigation.  

• 
Direct effects only. Only the direct effects that a given control could have (in the context of 
an ATT&CK mitigation or of a candidate mitigation) on an ATT&CK technique are identified. 
Indirect effects are not considered. Therefore, this analysis does not consider related 
controls.  

• 
Cyber resiliency focus. The analysis does not include mitigations that apply fundamental 
cybersecurity or standard cybersecurity controls or practices. Therefore, the entry for an 
ATT&CK technique will typically include only a subset of the mitigations listed in ATT&CK for 
ICS (i.e., mitigations that apply one or more cyber resiliency implementation approaches). 

G.1.2   Analysis Process 

The following steps describe the process used to analyze the potential effects of cyber resiliency 
on adversary TTPs identified in ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems (ICS): 

• 
Look for Parallels in ATT&CK for Enterprise. Determine whether and how the ATT&CK for 
ICS technique relates to techniques in ATT&CK for Enterprise. Some of the ATT&CK for ICS 
techniques are executed on an organization’s IT network rather than on its OT network. If

the ATT&CK for ICS technique resembles the techniques included under an ATT&CK for 
Enterprise tactic, the mapping of its mitigations and the identification of candidate 
mitigations are informed by the prior analysis of ATT&CK for Enterprise. 

Many of the candidate mitigations in the ATT&CK for Enterprise mapping involve the 
Deception cyber resiliency technique. Options for using Deception in an ICS environment, 
particularly on the OT network, are more limited than in an EIT environment. However, 
commercial offerings do exist for ICS, including deceptive PLCs and HMI systems. Active 
engagement with an adversary—whether via a decoy system or a full-blown deception 
environment—is resource-intensive and potentially disruptive. In the ATT&CK for ICS 
mapping, preference has been given to deception candidate mitigations, which are less 
resource-intensive (e.g., passive decoys rather than active decoys; deception environment 
limited to the IT network).  

• 
Map Mitigations. As in the ATT&CK for Enterprise mapping, the next step in analyzing an 
ATT&CK for ICS technique involves looking at the mitigations identified in the ATT&CK for 
ICS entry for that technique. Each mitigation, as used for the technique, is analyzed to 
determine whether it applies any cyber resiliency approaches. If so, the potential effects of 
the mitigation are then identified, together with the corresponding controls in [SP 800-53]. 
Otherwise, the mitigation is not considered further and is not listed in the mapping tables. 

Control identification considers any controls from [SP 800-53] identified in ATT&CK for ICS 
that correspond to a cyber resiliency control as identified in Appendix E. If the ATT&CK for 
ICS mitigation corresponds to an ATT&CK for Enterprise mitigation (indicated by its identifier 
having the form M09##), the uses of the ATT&CK for Enterprise mitigation are reviewed. In 
many cases, the ATT&CK for ICS mitigation includes actions and assumes capabilities beyond 
those associated with the corresponding ATT&CK for Enterprise mitigation. If one or more 
uses of the ATT&CK for ICS mitigation applies a different set of controls than those 
previously identified for ATT&CK for Enterprise, those controls are reviewed. 

While in many cases the ATT&CK for ICS technique-specific description of an ATT&CK for ICS 
mitigation includes both basic (i.e., cyber hygiene or standard practice) aspects and cyber 
resiliency aspects, the controls identified for the ATT&CK for ICS mitigation focus solely on 
the basic aspect. If the controls from the ATT&CK for Enterprise mapping or the controls 
identified from the analysis of the ATT&CK for ICS-specific description of the mitigation 
appear to be a better match for the ATT&CK for ICS mitigation than the [SP 800-53] controls 
identified in ATT&CK for ICS, they are presented in the mapping table in bold to indicate the 
divergence from the original ATT&CK for ICS mapping.  

• 
Identify and Map Candidate Mitigations. As in the ATT&CK for Enterprise mapping in 
Appendix F, the next step is to identify candidate mitigations. If ATT&CK for Enterprise 
parallels exist, they are reviewed to identify corresponding candidate mitigations. Additional 
candidate mitigations are identified by analysis of the technique description, its supporting 
literature, and review of information related to cyber resiliency techniques, approaches, 
technologies, and practices in the ICS domain. For each identified candidate mitigation, a 
technique-specific description is defined. Note, however, that ATT&CK for ICS does not 
include a section on Detection. Therefore, relatively few Detection candidate mitigations are 
identified using parallels with ATT&CK for Enterprise techniques. Potential effects are 
identified with corresponding controls in [SP 800-53].

• 
Cross-Check Consistency. Analysis of mapping consistency for mitigations is captured in an 
annotation of the listing of ATT&CK for ICS mitigations, as presented in [Bodeau21]. The 
consistency of mappings for candidate mitigations was addressed through a review of the 
technique-specific descriptions. Uses of mitigations and candidate mitigations for ATT&CK 
for ICS with corresponding ATT&CK for Enterprise mitigations and candidate mitigations 
were analyzed for consistency. Note, however, that the general and technique-specific 
descriptions are often at different levels of detail, and consequently, different controls may 
be identified. 

G.2   ANALYSIS RESULTS 

Tables G-1 through G-12 present the results of the analysis of potential effects of cyber 
resiliency on ATT&CK for ICS techniques. For each ATT&CK technique, the analysis includes 
relevant mitigations or candidate mitigations, cyber resiliency implementation approaches, 
potential effects on the adversary when the approaches are applied, and controls153 that can be 
employed to achieve the intended effects. A notes section following each table describes the 
relationships among ATT&CK for ICS and ATT&CK for Enterprise TTPs.

153 [SP 800-53] requires that a parent control be selected if one or more of its control enhancements are selected. This 
means that for any cyber resiliency control enhancement selected, the associated base control is also selected and 
included in the security plan for the system.

Notes: The Initial Access tactic in ATT&CK for ICS reflects elements of ATT&CK for Enterprise 
under multiple tactics. Data Historian Compromise (T0810) and Engineering Workstation 
Compromise (T0818) are examples of Lateral Movement. The adversary already has a presence 
in the IT environment and compromises a data historian or engineering workstation to gain a 
foothold in the control system environment. Drive-by Compromise (T0817) is similar to the 
corresponding ATT&CK for Enterprise technique since it involves an attack on the IT network. 
Other ATT&CK for ICS techniques with corresponding ATT&CK for Enterprise techniques of the 
same name include Exploit Public-Facing Application (T0819) with T1190, Exploitation of Remote 
Services (T0866) with T1210, External Remote Services (T0822) with T1133, Remote Services 
(T0886) with T1021, Replication Through Removable Media (T0847) with T1091, and Supply 
Chain Compromise (T0862) with T1195. Spearphishing Attachment (T0865) corresponds to a 
sub-technique under Phishing for Information (T1598) and Phishing (T1566). No ATT&CK for 
Enterprise technique corresponds to Internet Accessible Device (T0883), Rogue Master (T0848), 
or Wireless Compromise (T0860).

Notes: Techniques with ATT&CK for Enterprise counterparts include Command-Line Interface 
(T0807), which has some similarities to Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059); Scripting 
(T0853), which is related to Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) and Command-Line Use 
(T0807); Execution through API (T0871), which is related to Native API (T1106); Hooking (T0874), 
which corresponds to (T1056.004); Credential API Hooking, a sub-technique of Input Capture; 
Native API (T0834), which is related to Native API (T1106) and Execution through API (T0871); 
and User Execution (T0863), which corresponds to T1204. Change Operating Mode (T0858)154 
has no ATT&CK for Enterprise counterparts. 
 
 

 

154 T0858 is related to Activate Firmware Update Mode (T0800) under the Inhibit Response Function tactic.

Notes: Modify Program (T0889) is somewhat related to Modify System Process (T1543). Module 
Firmware (T0839) and System Firmware (T0857) share some similarity with Firmware Corruption 
(T1495), though T1495 is more oriented to denial-of-service. Project File Infection (T0873) is 
similar to Data Manipulation (T1565) and Modify Program (T0889). Valid Accounts (T0859) 
corresponds to T1078.

Notes: Default Credentials (T0812) is similar to T1078.001, Valid Accounts: Default Accounts. 
Since T0812 involves vendor default passwords, Present Deceptive Information and Cross 
Enterprise Usage Analysis (used for T1078) are not relevant. Exploitation of Remote Services 
(T0866) and Remote Services (T0886) have already appeared under Initial Access. Lateral Tool

Notes: A number of the ATT&CK for ICS techniques are similar to those of the same name in 
ATT&CK for Enterprise, including Automated Collection (T0802) and T1119; Data from 
Information Repositories (T0811) and T1213; Man in the Middle (T0830) and T1557; and Screen 
Capture (T0852) and T1113. However, differences can be noted. For Automated Collection, 
T1119 uses M1041, Encrypt Sensitive Information, and M1029, Remote Data Storage. Those 
mitigations are not used in ATT&CK for ICS since they are not applicable to operational data on

controllers and relays. Many of the candidate mitigations for T1119 are similarly inapplicable 
(e.g., Dynamic Data Location, Fragment Information). Active uses of Deception for T1557 are 
inapplicable in ATT&CK for ICS. No ATT&CK for Enterprise technique corresponds to Detect 
Operating Mode (T0868), Monitor Process State (T0801), Point & Tag Identification (T0861), I/O 
Image (T0877), and Program Upload (T0845). Wireless Sniffing (T0887) has been covered under

Notes: Commonly Used Port (T0885) is similar to Application Layer Protocol (T1071) in ATT&CK 
for Enterprise. However, T0885 focuses on ports (and associated protocols) while T1071 focuses 
solely on protocols. Standard Application Layer Protocol (T0869) is similar to Application Layer 
Protocol (T1071). Connection Proxy (T0884) is similar to Proxy (T1090).

Notes: Many of the ATT&CK for ICS techniques under this tactic have no corresponding ATT&CK 
for Enterprise technique. These include Activate Firmware Update Mode (T0800), Alarm 
Suppression (T0878), Block Command Message (T0803), Block Reporting Message (T0804), and 
Block Serial COM (T0805). Some correspond to techniques under the Impact tactic in ATT&CK 
for Enterprise: Data Destruction (T0809) corresponds to T1485, Denial of Service (T0814) 
corresponds to T1499 (and to a lesser extent T1498), and Device Restart/Shutdown (T0816) 
corresponds to System Shutdown/Reboot (T1529). Rootkit (T0851) has appeared under Evasion. 
System Firmware (T0857) has appeared under Persistence.

Notes: While Brute Force I/O (T0806) does not correspond directly to an ATT&CK for Enterprise 
technique, some overlap with Endpoint Denial of Service (T1499) can be found. Similarly, Modify 
Parameter (T0836) has some overlap with Date Manipulation (T1565). Module Firmware 
(T0839) has some similarity with Firmware Corruption (T1495), though T1495 is more oriented 
to denial of service. No ATT&CK for Enterprise techniques correspond to Spoof Reporting 
Message (T0856) or Unauthorized Command Message (T0855).

Notes: Most of the ATT&CK for ICS techniques under this tactic have no counterpart in ATT&CK 
for Enterprise. These include Damage to Property (T0879), Denial of Control (T0813), Denial of 
View (T0815), Loss of Control (T0827), Loss of Productivity and Revenue (T0828), Loss of 
Protection (T0837), Loss of Safety (T0880), Loss of View (T0829), Manipulation of Control 
(T0831), Manipulation of View (T0832), and Theft of Operational Information (T0882). Loss of 
Availability (T0826) has some similarities to Endpoint Denial of Service (T1499).
